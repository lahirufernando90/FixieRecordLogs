hello everyone

in this video we will look at the one

click document classification and we'll

see how we can easily create a document

classification machine learning model

through the document understanding

then we will see how we can use the same

data set to train the models

machine learning models to do the data

extraction and finally we'll see one of

the new features in the taxonomy manager

the field level validation

and the use of it

so let's get started

so we are in the document understanding

application over here you can access it

through this option

so the first thing you need to do is you

just need to create a project now I have

already created a project for this but I

will show you some of the steps and then

I will move into the one that I have

already created so it's easier

okay so how we can create a project is

just by clicking on this new project

so I will just say demo for now

and yeah and the advanced options you

will see the OCR method API key if it's

your document OCR it is automatically

picked from here

and if it's the

uipath OCR URL it is already here and we

just can say apply OCR on videos Auto

so these are the default properties you

can change it as you wish there are a

lot of ocrangies that you can use

so let's create this project

so once you have the project you can go

inside

and here we see a couple of options

you can see the document types

extractors and the classifiers so this

is in public preview

so the first thing is we need to define

the document types for us to train a

classifier

so earlier what we used to do is we used

to go into AI Center and use another

uh machine learning model that's

available in the out of the box packages

called document classifier and used to

train the documents from there but this

is much more easier

so how we can do this is first we need

to create a couple of document types

so in this case I have sample document

types like invoices and purchase orders

in each I have 10 files

like this

so first step is creating a new type

so under this button we have two options

one is

you can either use forms AI or fixed

layout forms or else you can use

semi-structured AI which means it will

take you to AI Center and you can train

a classifier for any type of model that

could be semi-structured or even

structured

whatever the document is

so in my case it's semi-structured

documents so you can basically use the

combination of both here depending on

your documents

so I will just use only the

semi-structure there

so all I need to do is just click on

this option and then

give a name for the AI Center project

so what this means is whenever you

create this it will actually create

another project in the AI center with

this name

so if you go into AI Center

I already have something called

so let me change the name

so I will name it like this

demo video

so once I created

it will ask for a session name

so this

basically means the type of the

documents so first I will say invoices

so the interesting thing here is you can

even use out of the box

ml models to train your model

so it's it's something like you already

have a set of AI models and you are

using the capabilities of those AI

models to train another AI model it's

pretty cool

so in my case I will just use this one

noises so this is the invoices out of

the box model

and once you select that

it will show you out of the box regular

Fields the model which is already

trained and these are the fields

that's available in the model

so just for the time being I will now

select everything I will just go with

the first few

and I'll deselect the remaining ones

you can basically do this depending on

your requirement

and then here you have the column fields

and again I'll keep the first View and

remove the rest

the other option you have is if you are

dealing with different currencies

you can even select those here

don't worry if you don't see your

currency here you can always add it once

the project is created

so for now let's keep all these things

and

so we just selected some Fields based on

the model we selected over here the out

of the box model

but let's say you have some extra Fields

extra regular fields and extra column

fields that you need to train on

you can Define how many extra columns

you need and depending on that it will

create a provision for you once the

the structure is created you will see a

couple of extra columns in the document

manager

so I will not change that now

and here we have the number of languages

so if you are having documents with

multiple languages you can Define

how many languages you have

and this is another important one

so when we talk about semi-structured

documents like invoices for example we

have so many different layouts

so we need to identify how many layouts

we are dealing with because we need to

train the model for all those layouts to

get the best possible accuracy

so in my case it's like 10 different

layouts because I have 10 different

invoices so I will just select 10.

so you can see depending on the numbers

and the configuration here it says you

need to have at least 50

documents to train it

to get a good good accuracy level a good

confidence level

so this will change based on your

selection

so let's stick with 10.

and once you create this will create

your project over here

so it's taking me to the document

manager so we'll quickly

check these two places

so here you can see the invoices the new

document type

and on the projects

if you refresh this page

um let me quickly refresh

you can see demo video this is the one I

just created

and if you go inside

you see you have a data set called

invoices

and the rest is not available here

you don't see anything under data

leveling because it's happening from

this place

and

for the data sets you will see the

invoices one which we just create

so let's get to the document manager

so these are the fields we selected and

if you select any custom field option

you will see extra columns over here and

in case if you want to change

the

currency classification

you can easily edit and add or remove

anything from here

okay so what's left is we just need to

import the documents here

so let's quickly import so I will say

patch on

select all my noises

and drag it over here

so for us to train a classifier we don't

need to label each and every document

all you need is just have all the

documents over here the different

layouts that you are going to use

and

it will automatically figure out what

kind of a document it is based on the

training

so you hit import

to import all the documents

so let's give it like couple of seconds

to complete the upload

in the meantime

you can also use this same

data set for the

the data leveling as well so it's just

using one data set to do both you train

a classifier and you also train an

extractor

and extractor training is same as before

as we used to do is just labeling the

documents

so once you have done this click on

close

and you have the documents over here

so before moving into the other document

type I'll quickly show you one

interesting feature is this predict

option so if you remember

we selected out of the box model when we

created this

screen

so what happens when you click on

predict is it will use that out of the

box model to actually predict the values

over here

so earlier we used revolutionary field

but with this predict feature

you can actually use the capabilities of

the AI model and automatically extract

the values

you can see it selected the currency

selected these fields

and here are the line items

you can see

even with multiple lines it was able to

accurately identify that

so I'm not going to do the labeling for

each and every document here but when

you get into leveling this is how you

can do you can click on fed it

let it label it and then if there are

any mistakes you can review and change

it

and let's say you want to change the

invoice number

all you need to do is just select the

proper

word or the set of words and click on

this shortcut key

press on the shortcut key so that the

value gets updated so I'm not going to

do any of that now

so this is all we need to do so we

basically don't need to label anything

for us to train a classifier all we need

is just have the documents here labeling

can happen later if you want to use that

data set for the extraction

so our invoice import is done now let's

try the purchase orders

so we just need to create another

semi-structured AI

and this time is

purchase

and make sure this does not have any

spaces

and again I will use the purchase order

model

and I'll just select a couple of fields

from here

just for our purpose

and same from column items

okay let's say we only have this

I don't have any custom Fields I just

have another 10 layouts

is the same procedure and then again

that will take you to another document

manager session session for the purchase

orders

so now we have two sessions

and if we quickly review here you have

the purchase orders

and on this side

to refresh the data sets you will see

both results

and under invoices you see nothing

because you have not done any exports

from the document manager

okay so for the purchase orders same

approach you just need to import

and that way you can train our

classified

so let me quickly show you once this

import is done

so what we do with these documents is

and and same way we Trend the invoices

you can do it for purchase orders or if

you have a different other document

types you can still work on it so let's

see what other out of the box options

are available

um as soon as this import is done

before we actually train a classifier

so our info is done for purchase orders

and here we have the documents

so same as before you can click on

predict and label the documents when

it's needed

so as I promised Let's uh I will not

create any other document type but let's

just see what options we have over here

so here we have custom document types

yeah so in case you are not going to use

any of these

options over here so we having the

titles different

documentaries financial statements bank

statements

contracts utility bills basically all

the out of the box options you have in

AI Center out of the box packages

and if you need to use any other

document type that is not listed here

you can always use this custom document

type then you can

training for those

just like we did here but only

difference is you will not have the

predict option because it will not

having

custom models that you can use

okay so let's cancel it and these are

the two options that we are going to use

and all you need to do is just click on

classify

and here we have two options

automated training or manual trading so

what's the difference

manual training is

when you select this it will only do the

export

it will export the data to our data set

that we saw in the eye center and you

can use that data set

within the AI Center to create a

training pipeline

but with automatic training it will do

that for you

so if I select this it will ask

what's the classifier name

so I will say

custom

demo classifier let's say

and I just need to select what are the

different document types I need

from what I created

and click on train

yeah so when we try to create it earlier

it had a red color validation saying you

have only

you have to have at least less than

10 documents so in my case I have 10

documents in both places

so as a quick installation just click on

the refresh so that you can see it

updates the page count here and then you

can

create your next one

remove classifier

and then select the options so that will

resolve that option

the issue

and then you just can click on trend

and if you go into

classifiers you can say

see that this is being trained at the

moment

so this will take a while so because of

that I will quickly go back and use the

one that I already

have with me

so let me close these extra things

so that I can show you the one that I

already have so it is the document

understanding demo

so I have two types the same two types

over here

and I have actually done the labeling as

well for this using that same method I

showed you

um and under classifiers

I have the classifier already available

so as as soon as that training is done

it will have the status available and it

will also give you these options so if

you click on detail

it will give you the data set link the

the score details

this is basically referring to the

confidence levels and accuracies

so I trained it on very less number of

documents

then you have the pipeline details that

it automatically created to train our

model and then the machine learning

skill so this is a public skill so you

can get the URL

um from here

coffee URL

so let me just quickly show you the

extraction part as well

I'll just show you for one

so here I have done the labeling just

like I showed you earlier

and all I did is

I can export it from here directly

so once you do the export

so

for the extractors here we don't have

the export option

like under this extractors

but

we can create it from here using the

same old method so you can export

as you usually do

click on all labeled

and then

export it so this will go and get

exported into your

um

data sets so this is my

previous data set

sorry there's another one

it is the document understanding demo

sorry for that

so here under data sets I have the

invoices purchase orders

and here you can see the export which I

did earlier

it's the same method that have in our

previous

videos

and then you can use the pipeline to

train it based on that export

and

then create the ml skill so for the

classifier it automatically created it

for me

once it was done through the classifier

option

so so this is the first part so this way

with

wearing thick

steps we can get a classifier up and

running so you don't need to do any

leveling all you need to do is just

import the documents run the automatic

training and you have the model

available in few minutes

and then the use of it I can quickly

show you over here

so here I have used the document

classifier scope and I'm using the

machine learning classifier

so this is the endpoint or the URL I got

API key you already know it is coming

from the admin page

and we can configure the classifiers

from here so it will show you the

document types we Trend it on

so that way we can get the

classification

easily from an AI model

so I will run this and show you but

before that let me just quickly show you

one thing

um so we basically covered two topics

first one is create a classification

skill and then using the same data set

to do the labeling and Export that data

and perform the

extraction skill creation

so if you want to go into very detail on

these topics you can refer to my machine

learning skill training videos I have a

separate series on that so it's the same

procedure over there

um so yes so we covered two and the last

one is the field level validation

so let me show you how it is done

so in the taxonomy manager I'm using the

latest version

if you go into

the document types

so here I have the invoices here I have

the purchase office

so I did the field level validation just

for a video purpose for these two Fields

a client name and the total amount in

purchase orders

so where to do that is you can select

the field and go into rules option

and here you can create any role

so we have a couple of operators here

and or or

and critical level is either should or

must

now what it should is

here you can see should indicate rule

which are not mandatory but rather a

guidance

but when you say it's a must that means

that condition must be fulfilled

and it is a

important thing no

so how you can create a rule is you can

add new so I already have one

which I created

that says this field should not be empty

so likewise you can create more

conditions

so for every condition you can add a

name

and you can say

how your condition is going to look like

so you can say either it is starting

with something ending with something or

contents or even you can have a records

and based on your selection over here it

will do the validation behind the scenes

and it will give you the result

so in my case so also once you create a

rule

give a meaningful name for this just

like I have done for the top five

so let me just delete this one

so here I'm saying this is it should not

be empty and this is my description

and I have done the same thing for the

total amount

the field should not be empty

so this will depend on the type you

select in here

the data type

so here is the name here is a number

so that is how you define the field

level validations

in

in the taxonomy manager

as business rules

so once you have done that then you can

easily consume it in your studio

so all we need to do is here we have the

present classification right after

classification scope

and we need to look through the

classification

and inside that we have the data

extraction scope and again we are using

the machine learning instructor

for the skills we created using the same

data set

and here we have the present radiation

station

so before showing you how to do the

field level validation let me

run this whole processor once and then

get to the last

so I have actually hard-coded the

document path here because it's for a

video and this is a

princess order

so let's quickly run it and see

and the other interesting thing I wanted

to share is while this thing executes

is when you have a lot of documents to

Trend you can actually use the same

document manager import all the document

variations you have there

and do the leveling

using the same methods you can even

create different schemes you can

um categorize those documents based on

your needs do all that and then you can

easily export it

and train the machine learning models

from there itself so it is very easy

when it comes to using that

because that way you can maintain one

data set to handle both

extraction and classification in case

you are using machine learning

so here we can see the model was able to

predict that this is a purchase order

and it was 77 percent confident

so now let's quickly see how the

extraction was done so I only created

the extraction for the purchase order I

did not create for any noises though I

didn't enabling

and here you can see

for the first disorder document we have

all the fields

and it was able to accurately extract

based on my training so I don't have the

line items here because it's again for

the purpose of showing this to you

but you can see one interesting thing so

I have the field level validation for

two Fields client name and the total

amount

and here you can see based on how I

Define it

it should be

the should it is not a must field

and you can see the condition what it is

this should not be empty

um

same goes here

so

this is how the validation screen will

show you this info

but

we also

need to know this information

before

we put everything into manual

verification

how you do that is let me just click on

subment here so I can stop the run

so how you can do that is

once you get the extraction results from

the data extraction scope

we anyway do a validation before getting

into manual verification

so in our validation logic we can use

that information

which is available in the auto

extraction result variable

and we can build our validation Logic

the conditions based on that

so how you can access the

the field level validations that's that

we did in the taxonomy manager is

there is a property in this variable

which we can use

so for that let me just uh

quickly enable this breakpoint so I can

show that to you while it is run

so let's run this again real quick

so we first get the classification

and then the data extraction will happen

and before executing the validation

station

so I'm not going to write any logic but

I'll show you that in the immediate one

and then based on that we can figure out

how we can build the logic

so it is the auto extraction results

variable

under after this dot you have this new

thing business rules result

if you go inside that

you can see a lot of information

let me expand this a bit

so here you can see rules that result

there are two

two items so this is kind of a array so

we have the validations for two phase

that's why we have two here

so if we

go here

and select the first one

it gives the results only for that field

and here how do we know which one is

which is actually based on the order of

the fields we defined in the taxonomy

manager

and here it gives you only the fields

that you have the validation defined

and again it's in the same order as you

see here the first one is

um

the client name

here you can see the value

and the second one is the total amount

so in my case when I say zeroth first

session it gives me the client name

and here in the result you can see

that field value result

it is valid

so the condition is valid and there is

no issue with the condition

so we can even check that

so we can get the field ID

and what the results are

so you along with this you also get

the field value

and

whether this result is true or not

so basically based on this uh

thing

you can

and for the condition you can also have

multiple conditions so that's why we

have a option here

so you can get the value

this is the actual value

and whether it is valid

so you can see the condition is true

so using these options you can build

your own validation logic when you're

creating

the flowchart probably

to build your validation

so this is one interesting feature

because there are a lot of cases where

we need to validate the content in

fields like amounts and when it comes to

text addresses

we need to write a lot of logic

and with this kind of features in

taxonomy manager

but still there are a lot more things

that they will on they can add to make

this experience much better but

um these features are very much helpful

to easily validate the content or the

data in these fields thank you

so

this is how we can actually

easily create a classification and

easily use the same data set to build

the extraction

and then

using the taxonomy manager he This Is

How We Do the field level validation

so you have all three in one video

so with that

um that's it for this particular video

so thank you very much for listening and

I hope this is this was helpful in

understanding this concept

so if there are any questions feel free

to put it down in comments or you can

always reach out then

I'll do my best to answer each and every

one of you

so thanks again for listening and I'll

see you in another interesting video

bye for now

all right
