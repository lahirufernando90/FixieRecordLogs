There are many approaches for extracting data from structured documents. Among those is template creation. However, template creation can be tricky when some parts change from time to time, such as rows of a structured table. This is where machine learning can help us easily predict and extract data from structured documents. 

#UiPath Forms AI lets us easily train a machine learning model without writing any code to extract data from documents. This video is focused on using Forms AI for document processing.

hello everyone

welcome to my new video on uipathforms

ai

so in this video we'll be looking at how

we can

create

um

ai model to extract data from structured

documents

so let's

first see what are the documents that we

are going to process and why we can use

forms ai to make this easier

so i have a set of documents like this

so let me quickly open it and show you

basically these documents look something

similar to this

um so here

what you can see is mostly the document

is structured except for this table so

these are some documents that i

downloaded from some of the websites

which you can also do it's already there

so here you can see

the table

it is dynamic in this page it can go up

to

in in this document it can go up to two

pages

in this document

it's pretty much the same but

the number of rows in this table is

less than the previous one and this has

a

this has only two rows

and in this is just one row

so

so these are some scenarios that we

encounter

most of the time

and we

try to see how we can extract

the documents from these kind of

and we see how we can extract data from

these kind of documents

so when you say structured documents

what comes to our mind is the form

extractor that we used

all these days to extract data from

structured documents

but the

limitation we had with that is that when

you have tables

where the row count differs time to time

we basically had to figure out the

different ways to

extract

data from those tables

so with forms ai we can make it

simplified

um and we can easily create a ai model

to extract

data from these structured documents

and even when the number of rows change

so let's see how we can do this in

uipath forms ai

so this is available on the cloud

platform which i'm using right now um

and you can also enable this feature if

you go to admin

and under this section you can see

forms ai as the document understanding

option

just make sure this is enabled

and once it is enabled you can find it

here on the left hand side panel called

document understanding

this is the

app that we are going to use to build

the forms ai model

so let me quickly brief you on this so

here

first we get into the overview page here

we can have multiple projects just like

in ai center we have multiple projects

and in each project we have different ai

models

so just like that in document

understanding

here also we can create multiple

projects and in each project we can have

different extractors

so

the first thing is we first need to

create a new project here

since those some of those are actually

um

documents that relate to financial stuff

let's

give it a name something

related to that area so all you need to

do is just click on new project

and let me give a name like

mr analysis

so the description bar is optional

uh other than that here you have a

couple of options like using the

ocr method

so if you use uipath document ocr

um the

ocr url is

this one and the document api

or the document understanding api call

it will automatically get it from the

platform itself

so you don't need to uh type it

so in our case let's use ui part

document ocr

and i'll keep these settings as it is

but if you are using a different ocr

module

um like this then you need to provide

the additional information

let's stick with this and i'll click on

create

and here we have our first project

so now what we need to do is we need to

get into this project and see

how we can use it

so just click on the project

and once you are here you have a couple

of options you have document types you

have a page called extractors

and this is something that is

uh coming up soon

we will see about that once that is

available

and you also have a settings option so

in settings you can just change the

project settings the same screen that

you saw before

so

once you are here the next thing that we

need to do is

we need to create a new document type

so for that you can click on this new

button

and we can

do it by actually using forms ai

we need to select on this option

and here we need to give a name for the

document type

and in our case these documents are form

4

so let's use the name form 4 for this

and then click on save

so after doing that you will actually

get redirected to a

different page

so this is

very much similar to the data manager

all the document

manager

um so it's the same thing used for forms

ai

and so we have a new tab here but in the

previous page

you can see

the

type is already created

and the extraction method is from say i

and that's what we are going to build

now

so the first step

we need to add a few documents here

so

this is what's recommended for now add

two to twenty similar documents with

maximum pages maximum five pages and

these are the different supported types

so let's add few documents we already

have four documents here

you can drag it over here

and

click on save so that it will start

uploading this document

it will take a couple of seconds to

finish the upload

just like in

data manager or the document manager

um once you upload it

uses the ocr engine to

read the document and

understand what's there right

so it's the same thing that is happening

here

it will

upload the files it will read it using

the ocr engine that we provided

and it will display all the documents in

the

screen

so let's give it a few minutes

to finish the process

okay so now we have

all the files uploaded and you can also

see

now the files has three pages some files

has two pages and these two files has

only one

and let's close it and start

the

process

so here you can see

it is automatically identifying the

fields

and it is automatically doing the

extraction

so for the first document it is already

done for us so now what we need to do is

um we need to figure out what are the

fields that we need and what are the

things that are not needed and just fine

tune this

extraction it automatically did

so let's see

so for our scenario let's only focus on

few fields

so let's

look at this omb number

and

this one this name is the requester name

and the issuer name and this date

and the rest will ignore for now

so let's delete this so i'll show you

how to delete

so if this field is not needed you can

click on this edit field

and hit on delete

and this is also not needed

this is okay this is okay and let's

delete the other pins as well

this process has been

uh

automated so that it's easy for us

only part that we need to

do

by ourselves is the

table extraction

so i'll show you how to do that after

configuring this part

okay

we have all the

normal fields that we need to extract or

the regular fields

we have omb number and let's also refine

this name

we can click on edit again

and click on this edit button

so that we can update the name

we can say

um

sure you don't have any spaces or any

other

special characters

um if you if you want to separate things

use this uh

iphone just like i have used it

and then click on set

and let's do the same thing for the

other one

okay so here we have the four fields

now

is the

part where we need to extract data from

this table

so so for that we need to use this

column fields so that part is not

automatically extracted so that we need

to define

for the first document

so let's see

um first we'll

add the fields that we need to extract

so let's focus only on three columns we

can use this title

transaction date over here and this

amount

so let's create that you just need to

click on this plus sign

and give a name

we have that column

and let's add the other one

and finally the amount

so once we add the

columns here we need to update one of

these columns

with a

special setting

so that setting actually defines

um

how you want to separate the rows

so here you can see so i clicked on the

title

here we have a additional option called

split items

as the description says use field as a

delimiter between line items or rows in

a table

so basically

we can use this column

to identify different rows

so let's

click on this option enable it and save

else what will happen is

um whatever you extract it will be in a

single row

okay so now we have the columns set up

now we need to

add the values to those

columns as rows

so i will not add all these rows i will

just add couple of rows

because adding all these rows will take

some time

so the first thing we need to define is

the items included in the row

so

we highlight the first row

and press on the slash

sign

so that it will highlight this

thing in green color

and then

you need to

identify

the elements inside

so we'll first highlight all the rows so

that it's easy

keep pressing that

so i will do this for like uh

six or seven rows

okay so this is my last row

but ideally you have to do this for

all the rows and one thing to remember

here is

when you have tables like this

that varies in number of rows

um you need to have a lot of samples

i cannot exactly say how many samples

you need so that depends on on your

scenario

but

if you have

tables in these documents that has

different

row counts

make sure you have a

large data set so that you can train it

on those so that the model will be much

more accurate because this is a part

that is dynamic

it's not as easy as

the normal fields that you see over here

so because of that

um

make sure you have enough documents to

do the training

okay

so now

we have all the documents ready

and we have highlighted

the columns here

so in my case i only have four documents

this just for this to show you how to do

this

um so let's

add the values to the first column

we highlight

the items that needs to go into that

from the rows that we identified

and then press on this shortcut key

and it will get added

to the

columns over here

you can do the same thing

to

transaction dates

which is r

and lastly the amounts

and eight

so you have everything in a single line

so we are done with the first document

now let's go to the second one

you can navigate through the documents

from here just like in

document manager when we are doing the

labeling through ai center

and now here instead of us

manually adding these values so it if

you remember it did the prediction

automatically for the first documents

for the regular fields but here it is

not there

but we can actually add it we can add

those things manually as well but

we can also use this predict option so

that is easier

so let's hit on predict and see how it

identifies the values

you can see it extracted the omb number

reporting person issuer name

and this thing is missing

so now we can update the things

um so

omb number is correct it's here

reporting person a part of it is missing

so all we need to do is just highlight

it and press on the shortcut

so that that part is also added

data earliest is this one

we can click on that and press the

uh e

and let's have take a look at the roka

in the table

so

based on my

update in the first document it was able

to identify

two rows here

but

it did not extract the remaining rows so

these things we need to update

so that's why i said when it comes to

rows over here we need more samples and

higher the number of documents we have

higher the accuracies

so let's quickly do a update here

so i'll update this entire line

you can also remove this row by pressing

the same slash key again

and

press it again so it updates the entire

row

the values are extracted properly

we'll do the same here

and

here the value is not correct so we'll

it extracted this value

so let me press on delete

and let's update the full row again

this is e

r

and the amount is

a so you can see the values are getting

updated

and let's quickly do that for the other

two

and

and lastly we have another row here

and we can select all three rows

press t

and r

and then the amount

you can see it's getting updated

the second document is also done

now the third one

we do the same thing

and click on predict

and see how it predicts

the tables will require a little bit of

fine tuning

just like you see over here

but

usually you can see the regular fields

are populated automatically without an

issue

this thing require a lot more training

because

the rows

don't change and you can see a lot of

green over here so let's

first highlight the whole thing and

press on the delete button so that

everything is deleted

and then we'll define our row

t

is the date

and the amount

that's the

third one and finally we'll do the same

thing for the other one

and this is the last document let's

click on predict again

okay so the first part is okay

let's update this part

this part will require a little bit of

training as i mentioned before

and okay

okay so we have our model

created

and we have labeled the values that we

need to extract

so

now what we need to do is we need to

publish this

um here there's a small change

you can see

along with this omb number

it also

extracted

one value over here which is extra

we can easily remove that

we need to highlight this and press on

delete

so the unnecessary things do not get

selected

okay so now we are done with this one

so now we can

click on publish so once we have labeled

everything the next step is publishing

it

and we need to give a name

so we can say

form

extractor for example

and click on publish

and then you will get this message box

saying publish is successful and we need

to copy this endpoint

so now relating this to what we have in

ai center if you're familiar about the

process over there

once we do the export from ai center

document labeling session it

expose the data into a data set and we

need to create the skill

but here

it creates the extractor for us

and we don't need to get involved in any

data sets or anything

all we need to do is just copy this

endpoint

and copy it

and close this

and if you go back to that previous tab

here we had

the document type and now if we go to

extractors

we can see the extractor that got

created just now

you can also copy the

endpoint url from here

and now from now onwards

it's the usual document understanding

flow

in uipath studio

so let's get to the studio

and again here what i have done is

i have the taxonomy created so let me

quickly show you

but before that let me show you the

dependencies i'm using here

these are the dependencies

document understanding ml activities

intelligent ocr

and the ocr activities

okay

so now let's quickly look at the

taxonomy that i have

just like in any other document

understanding process

we need to follow the same thing

so here i have created a group called

taxonomy

and uh

thing called finance and inside that we

have

coming

and then form four

so how

do you create all this is actually by

coming here and clicking on this group

creation and then the document types and

you can just basically follow the steps

and here we have

the form form

so here we have the fields that we need

to extract like the omb number the same

fields we have in the model

and under items we have those

three columns that we are looking at

we have everything defined here

the data types if you want to see

the amount is number this is date

this is string

this is again dead

text

text and this is also text

these are the

this is the configuration

this basically tells the robot that when

it comes to form four these are the

trees that we need to extract

all right so this is the first step

and we have the load taxonomy activity

and then i'm looking through a folder

so this folder is actually defined

in this foot folder so this is where my

all the documents are

you can see here

um

and for each document

as usual i do the digitize document

and here we have the uipath document ocr

and for the document ocr we need to use

the

endpoint

u dot uipad.com ocr and the api key

we can copy that from the cloud platform

if you are not sure let me show you

you can copy that from this admin page

and

under licenses

and services here you have the document

understanding api key

you just need to copy it

and

paste it here

let me quickly update this

okay

so

that's the digitization part and then

comes the data extraction scope

and over here for us to do the data

extraction we also need to give the

document type

what's the type of document that we are

going to extract

so in our case we don't have any

classifications here because we are just

dealing with only form four

and because of that i have given this

document type id

and this is coming from the tag summary

manager

and if you actually go to that document

com4 here you can find it finance

incoming form 4

and copy that

and paste it here

so

now

in the data extraction scope first the

activity or the extractor that we are

going to use

so here what we created is a ai model

so when it comes to ai models we need to

use the machine learning extractor

all we need to do is just look for that

machine learning

and

here we have it under extractors

drag it over here

once you put it it will ask you the

endpoint

ml scale and the api key

so let's copy the api key first

because i'm already here

copied

and then you can

not within double quotes just press the

api key here

and then the end point so for that we

need to

go back to our document understanding

go inside the project

extractors

copy url

and paste it here

make sure this is enabled and click on

get capabilities

so now we need to configure the

extractor so now you can see the

endpoint is here the api key is here

let's click on configure extractors

and

here we have

the

drop down the fields that are coming

from dml scale just like in any ml

extractor

we just need to map it now

i'll ump number

reporting person

issuer

um data earliest

and for items

um title

and the amount

and click on save

we have configured the extraction

now lastly to see the data here i'm

using the present validation station

so in this example i'm actually not

writing this data into any excel

um because that part is already covered

in

most of the videos that i have done

um

so that's why i'm

focusing only on the part where we need

to configure this thing

just to show you how it works

so here i will use the present

validation station to show the output of

the

data extraction scope

so that you can see how our forms ai is

working

so now we have actually completed the

flow

and let's do a quick run and see how it

works

so i already started the process and we

should see

the

variation station shortly

let's give it a couple of seconds

okay so we have the validation station

on my other screen

and this is how it looks like

so here we have

the omb number

this is a bit wrong so you can just

accept

but the reporting person that's correct

issuer name is correct

it is right

and let's see how the items look

you can see it was able to extract the

items

the things we define

and

there are few things

that are not extracted properly but as i

mentioned when it comes to these line

items you need more samples because

there is a dynamic part

let's click on save and continue

and let's see how the other document

looks like

it opened up in my

so this is the other one

here you can see the omb number is

correct

and i think even the line items up

yeah

for the last one you don't have a

transaction date

but it extracted everything properly

so

this is basically how you can use forms

ai

on structured documents and also on

parts where things are little bit

dynamic just like in these

tables so

i kept on repeating the dynamic parts

these tables make sure you have

more sample documents so that you can do

more labeling

and it will

try to extract

that data

automatically

and more accurately

and you can see how easy it is it's not

difficult

um

so i hope this is helpful for you to

understand how

the document understanding app and the

forms ai inside that

works

um so let me give you just one more

thing before wrapping up so let me

stop this if you wonder

how

to train uh already available extract

because this might be a question that

might be running in your heads right now

um so here let me close this

if you want to add more documents

to this uh

extractor

right now we only have like four docking

we just need to click on home 4

and it will open the forms ai

and from here

you can import any document

but make sure it is following the same

structure

you can add more documents you can

start labeling on those things just like

we did

and once you are exporting

or publishing

it will always ask for this name

and

if you don't want to use multiple

extractors

like

to be listed over here

you can easily

delete this

from here

and then give the same name over here so

that it will publish with that name

but the endpoint url might be different

so always make sure you copy it and

update it

you can actually verify

um whether that is different or not so

we'll give it a try

um since we talked about that

let me

delete this from 4 extractor

i already have the endpoint on the other

side

and we'll give the same name over

here and copy the endpoint

and

over here

um this is our previous endpoint let me

just

copy this new end point right below that

yeah

so you can see there's a small

difference

and

it's not the same so

if you are doing that make sure you

change the end point as well

okay

so that

brings to the end of the video

i hope this is helpful for you to

understand the forms ai

and

thank you very much and i'll see you in

another video if you have any questions

or any

thing that you want to ask

about anything related to uipath you can

feel free to ask

and i'll see you in the next video until

then take care
