hello everyone hope you all are doing

great

so with the latest release of 20.10

we have some amazing features related to

personal workspaces

in the uipath orchestrator

so what's really a personal workspace

it's something where you can have

a separate area in the same orchestrator

instance

where you can have your own packages you

can have your own

processors that

only you have access to or only a

selected

set of people have access to so that

you can do the development you can test

and you can finalize before moving into

the production environment

so with the uipath orchestrator folders

how can you manage the personal

workspaces

let's have a look

so this is the latest version of the

uipath orchestrator so i'm showing you

the

community version over here and this is

the new design

so as of now

once you publish a package

it's shown under the packages option

so if you go to this tenant

under packages you will see all the

published packages

and whenever you create a process

inside the different folders which can

be your classic folder

or which can be a modern folder

the process will reside inside each and

every fold

but the packages

are common to the end

for the tenant so there are two levels

you have the tenant level and you have

the folder level

if you check the folders

and if you go to automations and

processes

here you can see the processors

available for

that particular folder

and it's the same for classic folders as

well

but as you see when i try to create a

new

process it always looks for

the same packages option

that we have in the tenant level

so when it comes to personal workspaces

we should have a place where we can have

our own

packages as well so that

it won't affect the

product production packages

that's already available in the tenant

level

because these packages we update time to

time we delete

different versions we test it

we do a lot of things

so it's always good to have a personal

network area

where we can do these things

so you have uipath have introduced

one great feature that's coming up

with the modern folders where we can

create our own

workspaces

so to check that we can

click on the tenant again

and if you go to folders

here you will have all the available

folders for you

so let's create a folder once you click

on the new folder

you'll see some new options over here

so you can select whether it's a classic

folder

or a modern folder so for classic

folders

those other options will be disabled

modern folder is what is going to be

therefore in the long run as

most of the new features that are coming

in will be added to the modern folders

so when you talk about the modern

folders

here we have two options

you can access the packages

so here it says processes process

packages source so it's asking for the

source for the packages

whether it's the tenant packages field

or whether you want to create a new

package feed

for this particular folder so 10 and

package feed means

the packages feed over here

so the option is asking to create a new

package feed

it will have its own feed for packages

inside the folder itself so let's try

that

so let's provide a good name for this

folder

and i'll be creating a modern folder

with this option

create a new source new feed for this

folder

and i will create it

so this folder is available now

if i try to create any subfolders

for this particular folder it won't have

that

options available so if you see this

if you see add subfolder you only have

the

ability to provide the name and the

description

so all those features are available only

for the first

level of the folder hierarchy

so if we actually check the check this

over here for this package it says

folder packages

and for other other folders you don't

have anything like that

why you have it here is because it's a

special folder where it has

its own package feed

so now let's have a look at the folder

on the left hand side panel go to that

folder

and here you will see all the available

features you can do a comparison as well

if you go to automations here you will

see a difference

so in our new folder

we have folder packages option whereas

if we

check the other folders you don't have

that

so this is our personal workspace

in this folder and you can add any

number of users as well

through folders go to the folder

and here you can add any users who want

to access that

so if you go to the folder again go to

automations

if you go to folder packages you can see

all the

packages that can be available in this

folder

so how do you up add packages to this

you can either upload just like you are

doing it to the

packages feed at the tenant level or

else

you can add packages from the studio

itself

so how do you do that let's have a look

at the studio

so here i have a simple

workflow where i have a message box

i'm not focusing about workflow designs

or anything because our

main idea is to talk about the folders

and

personal workspaces

so if i click on publish

and go to publish options

i need to refresh

and click on publish options

here we have two options now

so earlier we used to have orchestrator

tenant

processors feed and we had the custom

field

where you give your own folder path

and if you have any api keys and it and

it will be

published to that particular photo

and in the channel feed it's the

old version or the old feature that we

had

where you publish the packages to the

tenant level packages so as you saw

earlier once i refresh we have a new

option here

so here it says orchestrator test

package

feed feed so this is actually the name

that i gave

for that folder as

i see here this package feed

so we'll publish this package

to that particular folder

click next and publish

so the process has already published

successfully

and now if we go to the folder and do a

quick refresh

we can see the process we already

published

and if we actually go to tenant level

and in packages if we search for it

it's not there so it

it will be only visible with

for this package itself

yeah it's over here

and when you want to create a process

out of this package you can easily go to

processors

select the package so here the other

thing is

you don't see the packages available in

the tenant level

you only see the packages

that are in folder packages so

when you are creating processors again

you can only create processors

for packages that's available inside

this folder

because it's your personal workspace and

you don't need to interact with the

other packages or other processors

available at the tenant level

so you can create just like

we used to do and create the process

okay so what's remaining is to create a

job

and run the process so before running

we need to make sure of one thing

if you are having an unattended robot

you need to add

the machine template

to the folder if you are having an

attended robot that's fine

so go back to tenant go to folders

and test package feed

so in my case i am having an unattended

robot

assigned to myself so i need to

add the machine template as you see here

it's an unattended protein robot

so go to folders go to the package

sorry folder and

under machine templates you can simply

add

the machine template that you have

created earlier

and click on assign

why you need to do this is because you

need to have a runtime

available to run the packages

or the processors inside that folder

and now since we have configured that go

back to the folder

go to automations go to jobs

and let's create the process

job i'll select my process

and again as you see here we can only

create

jobs with the processors available

inside this package

it won't show any process or package

available in the tenant level

and my job type is going to be

unattended

so it can be any user and any mission

so if you have a specific user you can

simply click

and select the user and simply

you can select the machine as well

because in my case i have already

one machine so it can be set as

animation

so let's see how this works so i'll

start the process

and it's running

so this is the message in my workflow

and it's successful so if you

check the assistant screen

you also have that process

under the folder name

so here you have the folder name and the

processors available inside that

so you already have the same set of

options just like in other processes

you can see the process details so

everything is there

yeah so that's how you create the

personal

workspaces and that's how you can easily

organize

the processors and the packages that you

are working on

before moving or before publishing it to

the

tenant level packages so that

by by using this way you can

have your things organized and if you

are working as a

team you can have all the team members

assigned to this particular folder

and have them working inside the folder

with the packages

and with the jobs and processes without

affecting

the production level or the tenant level

packages and processes so this way you

can easily organize

your stuff

and you can make sure that you don't

overwrite the tenant level packages time

to time

for your testing purposes so whenever

you are done

with the final versions and whenever you

are ready with that

all you need to do is go back to the

internet level

publish the final workflow to that

package

or if you have a different

architecture where you have a different

folder for

all the production level packages or

processors you can do the same approach

and add that final version there

and to have the process running from

there itself

so it depends on the architecture that

you are using

and the best practices

so whenever you need to delete

or whenever you need to delete

update these packages or processes you

simply need to

do the changes inside the folder itself

just like you used to do before

and it will all effect inside the folder

thank you very much and i'll see you in

another video

with many other new features

thank you very much have a great day
