hello everyone so in this video

we'll be discussing about another new

feature

that your body introduced in 20.10

release

it's about multiple entry points

for the process so as

you know um up to this point when we are

designing processors

we had only one main xml file

in a solution and

whatever we do when we are executing the

process

through the orchestrator or through

uipath assistant

the process starts from the main xml

file itself

or whatever the file that you have

defined as the main file

in the solution but

when we are going ahead with

scenarios in some cases we need

to access each and every individual

file to do certain processes

for example there can be a process

where you need to access different

uh sub processes in the same process

to handle certain things let's

take a simple example here

so assume there's a process where you

need to

do simple calculations so simple data

manipulations

and in that process you have

multiple workflows to handle certain

things

so in my example over here i have a

process

where i have two workflow files

to perform addition of two numbers

and multiplication of two numbers

so if you are to handle this kind of a

scenario

um depending on the operator we provide

assume that user is going to provide

operator

along with the number just like a

calculator

depending on the operator you need to

identify

which workflow to execute

so before all this time

we had to have another

another workflow to identify

identify was the operator and

invoke the workflow inside

that process itself

so the difference here is now with this

multiple

entry you can define multiple processors

sorry multiple workflows where you can

enter or execute the process

[Music]

so the advantage of doing this is you

can have

or you can create separate processes

that handle certain common

tasks but different to each other for

example

assume that you have a process

that interacts with the database so what

do you do

when you are interacting with the

database

you insert records you update delete

and you also query for new records

so all these things can be put into a

separate process

and you can have multiple entries

for these actions

and execute the same process to

perform multiple different things

by entering into the process through a

different workflow each time

so this is something similar that i'm

going to show you in this video

so as i explained earlier in a process

when we define

it as the main workflow

that main workflow is highlighted in

kind of like a

bold text so likewise you can

always set a workflow as the main

but each time that is the workflow

that's going to execute

by default to start the process

but here what i am going to show you is

assume that this is my main workflow

but depending on certain scenario or a

certain input that comes in

for another process from another process

i need to execute different functions

in this particular process like the

addition and multiply

so i have another process over here

where i get input

so the user will input two values

number one and number two through input

dialogues

and the user will also provide the

operator whether user needs to

perform the addition or multiplication

um and based on that input

i'm going to invoke another process

to perform the action

so this is the sample workflow that i

have

developed for that so i'll get back to

this later

so before that

considering this scenario this is the

process that i need to invoke

based on the user input and i have the

addition

xml file where i get the two numbers

and i perform

the addition

and assign it to a variable and show it

in a message box

and on the other workflow i get the two

numbers again

and this time i'm going to multiply that

instead of

sum it up and showing it in a message

so so by default this addition is the

main

workflow and it will be invoked all the

time when i invoke the process

but i need to invoke this multiply xml

workflow as well

depending on the user selection

so all you need to do is you can right

click on this

so this is already enabled

so all you need to do is you need to

right click on this

and select enable entry point

so you can also see a small arrow a

green color arrow

along with the icon of the file that

says

that you have enabled entry point to

these

two workflows so that means when you are

invoking a process

you can start the process either from

the main

or the addition xml or through the other

files that you have mentioned as entry

point

so so there is a very very simple

scenario that i

use to explain this concept

so once you have done that you can

simply publish it to orchestrator so

let's do that now

so i'll publish it to a separate folder

so the benefit of doing this is you can

have separate processes

um in kind of like a layered

architecture

in the entire process so in other words

when you're

developing automation solutions

sometimes you have to create multiple

automation processors to handle the

entire

automation just like the dispatcher and

perform

processes that we have all done

throughout the academic courses

similarly there can be scenarios where

you need to have some layered

architecture where

the you need to invoke processors to

perform various different things like

data manipulations or

database related interactions just like

i mentioned earlier

and in such cases having this kind of

a entry point is very helpful

so since we have already published

let's get to the orchestrator so this is

my folder

and if i go to folder packages i see my

process

so let's create a process from that

so there's nothing different in

setting up the process in the office

trader as of now

so all you need to do is to create the

process

this is your process name

so this is the difference now in your

other process

so whenever you are invoking this

process you need to

now define from which workflow that you

need to start the process

so going back to my other process

so i have three variables

over here test value test value

and selected operation so these things

three are populated through these

three input dialog activities

first one will get the first value that

use enter

second value and here

we are specifying

what sort of operation that you are

going to do

so it's easy to set it up

you can select this input type as

multiple choice and you can give

the options that you need to have

separated by a semicolon

and get that value to a variable

and so here we get two options

so the output of this will be this and

text of the option you see that so if

you select addition you will get the

text addition if you select

multiplication you will get the text

multiplication

and now based on this i need to invoke

that process we

published

through different workflows so i'm using

a flowchart here

for us to easily

visualize this so in the flow chart i

have a flow switch

and in properties i'm providing the

selected operation which is a string

because it gives us the

text and

i'm outputting one as the addition

so once you drag this line so i can show

you that

so once you drag this option

and connect to the invoke process by

default it says

default or case 1 case 2 and so on

so i can show you the other options as

well

so this this is case one

so just by connecting it it won't

identify what values you are getting

from

so you need to specify if you get

addition you have to go on this path and

if you get multiplication as the text

you have to go on this part so let's do

that

and you have to select this line

go to properties and on the default case

type

provide the text that you get from

the input dialogs it's addition

so it has to be similar to what you see

over here

and for the next one select it

and it's multiplication so remember you

don't need to

provide double quotation over here this

problem in the text will be sufficient

and so this is the interesting part now

you're going to use

invoke process

so in this invoke process i'm going to

invoke

the addition so i have two workflows now

in the same process so i'm going to

provide the process name

over here so this name is exactly the

same

as what you see over here

if you can copy and paste it as well

and for the entry point here by default

if you do not provide anything

it will invoke the main xml file

by default but if you need to

since you have multiple entry points you

can define

what workflow that you notice so

for the sum operation

in my other process

addition xml is the default

or the main but i will provide the

file name here

edition and under

arguments you have to provide

what arguments this workflow file is

expecting

so in our case for addition

we have two input arguments

the two numbers in integer type

so use this name argument name

and in edit arguments provide the

argument name in the workflow

set the direction as input and the type

is end now this

test value 1 and test value 2 is of

string type because user is entering

that

an input dialog is capturing it as

string

so let's we are converting it here

into integer to the type that our

workflow is expecting

and we have one more thing to do

in the properties you need to specify

where this process is so by default

when you invoke this process while

you're running

it will look for this process in the

default folder

in the orchestrator which means

in this folder but we have published it

into a different folder

so in that case you need to provide the

folder path

so for custodial folder path

i have provided my folder name

and for target session you can say

that this process has to be executed in

the current session

or whether you need to execute in a

picture in picture

or any other option that you need so

i'll set it as

current

so the entry file we have defined it and

for the other process

for now multiply is the same only thing

different is

the entry point here you are defining

the other xml file as the

entry point so that this time is

not the main main file but

it is we enabled it as a entry point

for that process

so by doing this you

invoke the same process

but from different places to perform

different actions

and to get an output from the same

process

so

going back to my example of databases

so as i said earlier we can have a

separate process that handle all these

database related

actions for a specific use case

and we can have four different workflows

in the same process where

one workflow is always doing the

selection or query depending on the

query that you provide and another

workflow will

do the update another workflow will do

the insert

but you are invoking the same process

over and over again to perform

different actions so

that's the benefit of having this

multiple entry points

so because it enables you to

design your entire solution in a

layered architecture which

comes as a best practice as well

so since we have developed this work for

now

let's give it a try and see how it works

and we have already published our other

solution into orchestrator

so let's run this

[Music]

okay so here we have the first

input dialog i will say 1 10

and 30 20

and this is the multiple choice

operation which we defined here

so i'll go for addition

and you can see it's executing the

process

invoke process and we got the message

box

saying the value is 30. so this message

box is coming from

that other process

yeah so this process executed inside our

master process itself

and we got the update and let's try the

other option

now

[Music]

running the same process again

and this time i will do the

multiplication

so 25

and let's see how it works

and again you can see it's working and

this time we got the different we said

not saying

the multiplication value is 125

so you can invoke

process using invoke process as well

and the other option you have is you can

invoke this

thoroughly so you can use the

so you can use the run parallel process

to run this for yourself so let's

try that now so instead of

using more process over here i will

remove this for now

and i will use run parallel process

and let's see how that works

so i need to provide the text

so what happens in run parallel process

is while you

while this process is running

the other process will run parallel to

the process that's already running and

provide you the input

of the output so in invoke process

it ran inside the same process but in

parallel process

uh the the master process over here

or the process that we are running will

give the run command to the other

process

and it will continue executing and

the and our

other process which handles the

multiplication and addition

will run separately and give you the

output

without waiting for the

main process over here

so i need to give the process name again

which i can copy

from this one

this is my process and entry point

i'm going to say

it's multiply xml

and the opposite of path is my folder

which is test package feed

which again i can copy from my other

process

and it will be in the same current

session

so i need to provide the arguments now

so let's create the arguments in m3

so i'm using the same algorithm names

you see here in the multiply workflow

type is

in 32

and i'm converting our output

right so we have done that

and let's see how this works

so i'm going to run this uh our

process so we know that addition is

already working

because we didn't do anything there so

we'll try

to run the multiplication

so this process actually stopped

and my other process

gave an error it's because

it says a foreground process is already

running and only one program process can

run at a time

yes so so all you need to do is

when you are running parallel processors

in the same

machine um

you cannot run multiple foreground

closes as you know

so you can do one small thing you can

get back to our process over here where

you have that

addition and multiplication

go to project settings and

set it as starting background

and

save and we have to publish again

and i'm going to publish into my folder

so published successfully

get to orchestrator

uh folder packages

this is our process and for processes we

need to update that

go to view process

upgrade it through this option

close so now we have updated version

and let's see whether it actually runs

in the background

so in jobs you can actually see our

first

uh attempt to run it thoroughly has

faulted because it's it wasn't set to

set as a background process

so let's try that now

um okay i'm going to run this

and i will give some input

and multiplication start and you can see

that process

executed and you also notice that this

process actually completed

and later you got the message box

and if you check the assistant

and you can see our background process

executing

so that's how you can

build processors with multiple entry

points

where you can design your solutions in a

in different layers to perform very

different tasks

but within the same process itself

so i hope this video will be helpful

in identifying or understanding how you

should

build or design your process in a way

that can support various layers and to

support different actions that are

common

to a specific task like databases

and i hope that you understood the

concept behind

multiple entry points and why it is

useful

to have in designing

this kind of process so

thank you very much and i will see you

in another video

have a good day
