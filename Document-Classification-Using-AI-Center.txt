hello welcome to a new

document understanding video so

this is not a part of the advanced

document understanding series that i

published

this is a separate video that's focusing

on one of the

very latest releases that you have did

on

document understanding so in this video

we will focus on the new classification

features

that comes in with the combination of

ai with the document understand

so one of the latest release is

your path has introduced ai

fabric classification module to

classify documents using ai models

so for that what we can do is

you need to do few things

so ideally i would assume that you

already know

how to use ai fabric and you already

know the basics of

document understanding and how to

classify it

so to do that the first thing i need to

do

is i need to so

basically what happens here is you

upload a data set

to ai fabric and there

you train the ai model that uipath has

introduced

and using that trend model you do the

classification without

using the keyword based classifier or

intelligent

keyword based classifier so

why they have this is because there are

some instances where

either the keyword based classifier or

the intelligent keyword classifier

does not really work when it comes to

various dynamic document layouts and

various different ways of representing

the same type of document with a lot of

different other letters and words

so machine learning classifier is one of

the best

answers for that okay so to

how to configure that is before getting

into studio we'll take a look at the ai

fabric

so i have a project created

over here don't worry about all these

data sets and

packages i have just focus on

the steps i do so the first thing is i

need to create

a folder under data sets to

hold the data we are passing to train

the model

i will say uh

document

specification

so this can be a name can be any name

as you know

so in this folder we are not going to

create anything it will

get created automatically through our

uipath studio workflow

so we created the folder and now we are

going back

to your studio and i

already have a taxonomy created for

invoices account creation forms and

purchase orders

and in these dependencies

you have to use

let me yeah

you have to use the latest version of

uipath document understanding ml

activities

and intelligent ocr activities so i'm

currently using the latest preview

if you do not see this preview over here

click on this filter

and select this include free release

and this will get visible to you

so after you install these two

um next comes the

normal sequence of activities that we

are

usually use when it comes to document

understanding

uh workflows so i already have the load

taxonomy

and i have a for each law uh root

for each loop to loop through a set of

files

so i have the files over here

these are some of the purchase orders

and invoices and account creation forms

so i will look through that and i will

do the digitizer document

and for the initial step because we need

to

pass the data to ai fabric to train the

data

train the ai model i'm using the

classified optimal scope

with intelligent keyword classifier

so over here i have trained it for

couple of documents

and i'm using that for all three

and i already have a present

classification station to verify the

result

and this is the part that's going to

change

so as the first step we are going to use

the train

classifier scope so you are already

familiar with this activity

and we are using the output of this

present classification station

as the human validated classification

data

and using that

now is the now is the point where we use

the new activity

we have a new activity called

machine learning classifier trainer

this activity

and i'm using that over here

and it will ask for my skills so we

don't

have any skills as of now so i will just

cancel

it and i need to

click on this refresh and i'm going to

select the project

that i have in my ai fabric so if you

have a couple of projects you will see

more than one so i only have one

it's document understanding and that's

the name you see over here

and then i need to select the data set

so in my data set there are a couple of

folders

as you see over here i have several

other folders and this is the folder we

created

and i'm using that folder to

train the classifier

doing that i will click on

configure classifiers and i will apply

this for all three and

for each type of document i need to

specify a folder name

so this the name you provide over here

will get

applied in a fabric so

for example if i say invoices here

this folder name will create get created

under

this document classification folder

and then i'm going to give another name

for account

creation form

and also for purchase order

so make sure you don't specify any

spaces if you

need to use special user uh character

like this

and i will click on save

so we are ready to upload the data

so i will run this and let's see

the output

so it's running in the background

so we have couple of documents it will

take a little while because we need to

manually

specify that as well

one

okay so you are familiar with these

steps

and we already get

the classification from intelligent

keyword classifier so let's save it

you just need to keep on doing that for

all the

documents as long as you have a

trend classifier

it should be easy

this is just for the learning purpose

so as that got executed if you check

the document classification you could

see

a new folder account creation form

and under that you can see the text

representation

of the document

so likewise all the files that you

process will get uploaded

to this particular folder

and this is another type

and we have another invoice

so in this one we have two different

documents one is the invoice and one is

a

purchase order let's change that

so let's change this as a invoice

and this as a purchase order and after

training

we'll see how this gets identified

properly

um yeah so i'll

save it so all the manually verified

data i will get uh will be used

to train the classifier

and that data will be uploaded to ai

fabric

this is another invoice

and this is another one

so a couple of more documents are left

so to do a training properly you need to

have at least

two documents for each type

if you have less than that your training

pipelining ai fabric will fail

and this has not got identified so we'll

specify that as invoice

and this is another purchase order

so i think we are

getting close to the last document

there's another one

yeah i think this is the last document

let's say invoice

okay so that part has ended

so going back to the document

classification

in a fabric now we see three different

folders

in account creation form we have two

files

and invoices we have more than

two and for purchase orders

we also have uh two files over here

okay so we have uploaded the data if you

actually download one

and let's see what kind of output we

have there

so you can see the text representation

of the entire document

so this is the data that it

will be using to train the ai model

okay so now the next thing is

we need to create a ml

package to train this

trend using this data and under ml

packages if you go to out of the box

packages you will see

uh if you go inside you are part of your

understanding

you will see a new package called

document classifier

we will use that and

we'll be using the 2.0 version because

it's the

available version and you can see it's a

retrainable

model so i will click on submit

and i will say scale

document classifier

you can provide any name i will keep

these configurations as it

is

okay so we have undeployed

uh ml package that we can

train so next thing is we are going to

go for pipelines

and we are going to create a new

pipeline to

train this package we created

using the data we have in this document

classification folder

going into pipelines i will create a new

pipeline

with the

type as trend

and i'll be selecting the package as

skill document classifier which i just

created

the version is this is zero

and we'll be selecting the input data

set as

document classification because this

folder we created to train

the data and

finally i will select run now and just

click on create

so you can see it's the status as

packaging

so this will take a couple of minutes

to execute

so after packaging it should

turn into running state

yeah so this will take couple of minutes

so i will pause the video for now

and we'll get back after this complex

okay so we have the pipeline uh it was

created successfully

and we have the trained version of the

package now and the next thing is using

this trained

package we are going to create a new

ml skill so um

i will navigate to ms skills

and yeah and create a new one

um okay so before that if you go to ml

packages

and if we click on this you can see

there are two versions so

originally this was the version i

created and

this is the trend version 2.1

and this is the version that i'm going

to use to create my

skill so click on create

and scale

classifier

say skill document

classifier package version

is this the scale document classifier is

my package

two and one because i'm

i'm going to use 2.1 and i will click on

create

and you can see that new version 2.1 is

being deployed

and this will also take couple of

minutes

so let's wait until that's complete

so and now we have the scale

available and the

next part is so we have done everything

in a fabric

and we have the scale ready to be used

in our workflows getting back to studio

now instead of uh using the intelligent

keyword classifier over here

we can simply remove this and we just

copy the key

just in case you can remove the

intelligent keyword classifier

and instead of that i'm going to use

machine learning classifier so earlier

we use the machine learning classifier

trainer

over here and now i'm going to use the

machine learning classifier

to predict the document type

and you'll get a message like this click

on ok

and then refresh and select the machine

learning skill

for classification so this is the skill

that we created

and the api key we can paste it

and click on get arguments

and then you have that available

and all you need to do is click on

configure classifiers

and right here for these three document

types

we are going to use it and you can see

when when i click on this

tick it highlights it as a

inner red square so what you need to do

is you need to select from this drop

down

which type of classifier you need to use

for each

type so we train the model for three

different types

and those three types are available in

this

drop down so for invoices i'm going to

use

noise concretion and the purchase order

and click on save

so now you have created that and you are

ready to use it

so let's see whether it predicts the

document type properly based on what we

trade

so in each run you can use this

train classifier scope with machine

learning classifier trainer

to update each document into ai fabric

and create a pipeline schedule it to

trend the module continuously based on

the data you process

so that it can improve the accuracy over

the time

so by having it like this

i can simply save it

and run it for the same set of files

let's see

how it predicts the data

so you can see it's running from the

output panel

and for some documents the ocr part

takes a little bit of more time

okay so you can see that it has executed

okay so

this document has not got recognized we

can

do the training so

it's just one round of training that we

did but

when it comes to proper training

it gives you a more accurate result

and we have to train it with more

documents

to give a proper result in that case

so let's see how it raised the other

documents

so ideally you get the idea on how to

use it

and how to build a workflow using

machine learning classifier to classify

your documents using a machine learning

model

so that's the idea of this video

and here we have the next one and it has

identified the classification properly

so better higher the number of samples

that you use to train

the better the result you get

so every time when when you run this

it will get trained as i explained

earlier

so this has identified as invoices with

88

accuracy and the configuration

and this one again it has not identified

so let's

mark it

yeah so with the next round of training

this thing will

get identified properly i believe

just need some more training

and this has identified

and this is also correct

and this that's right

yeah so that's how the model

work and i think this is the last

document

this is the next one

you can see that it's identifying the

documents properly

so what you can do is once you do the

test with

a couple of documents you can try a

different set of documents and see how

it

identifies the new set of documents to

actually get the result

so so this is the document and you can

see that it's

identified properly okay so

that's how you use the new

[Music]

machine learning classifier and the

machine learning classifier trainer

and i believe you got the idea

on how to train the new classification

model that we have in a fabric so

try it out enjoy and

share your thoughts as well thanks for

watching
