In this part of the video, we will mainly focus on how we can use the Data Manager to label documents and train it for invoices. I know the invoice model is already available. But doing this gives you an idea of how to train a model for any type of document (by using the generic DocumentUnderstanding model) apart from what is readily available in AI Center.

hello everyone

welcome to my new video this is again

on training document understanding

machine learning models through data

manager

so i know this has been a long better

video uh after the document

understanding series that i did

so why i got delayed is actually because

data manager was inside the program

but now since it is available in the

trial

i thought this is the best time to

support you guys

with this requirement

so training these models

uh we have to do that through ai center

and through a tool called data manager

that comes in as a part of

ai center now so there are different

ways to

train the models let's get to

the ai center so that i can show you

how to do each other

okay so we are in here is center now

is our newly created project

so if you go to ml packages

under out of the box packages

and under document understanding we see

different

models created for invoices purchase

orders receipts and so on

so these modules are actually

pre-trained as we know

and they these models have their own

fields

that we can easily deploy and use to

read our documents

and on the other hand this document

understanding model which is

a generic one which we can also retrain

but compared to the invoice and purchase

order models

the document understanding model over

here do not have any predefined fields

so if we are using this model we need to

train it from scratch

so as of today's video i will focus on

not on this but i will focus on

how to train a model the invoice model

so by doing this you will also get an

idea how to

apply that same concept to train the

document understanding model

which is this one which can be applied

to trend for any kind of document

because this is a generic model that you

can use

on different kind of other documents

okay so for the time being let's focus

on the invoice model

so the concept is the same always

but there are different ways first thing

is

using the data manager to do the initial

training

and then using the

train extractor scope in the workflow

itself

to generate the training or the human

validated

results to do the training much more

easily

that is a part of another video so in

this one we'll

focus on how to do the initial training

on these models okay

so i'm going to use this a noise model

as of now

you can see there are different versions

i'm using the latest

for the name i'm going to say

invoices i'm not going to change any of

these things

so as you know this is a free trend and

it has its own fields

we can just deploy it as an skill and

use it it is already trained up to a

certain action

but i'm going to show you how to improve

this

through the data manager okay

so once we have the package here

how can we figure out what are the

fields that this model has

so to do that we can go to

this link on the docs.web.com

configure data manager and if you scroll

down

here we can have some we have some links

to download the schema for these models

so i have already downloaded this one

for invoices because we are using the

inverse

they can also download and once you

download and

export it

to download it and export you will see

something

download it

we have a split file and also

a json file so if we open this one

and see all the available fields for

that model

including the data type and couple of

other properties

that will come in handy when you are

using the data package

we will get back to this after we create

the mod

coming back here now since we created

the package

i'm going to go for my skills and

create a new film

i'm going to use the package

settings again so this major version and

my version was

actually coming from the package itself

this is the only version that's

available

so for the time being i will keep this

auto

enable auto update uh thing disabled

and we'll cover that in a separate video

and this option on deploy skill after

period of inactivity i will

keep it default one week

so it will automatically undeploy this

if this model is inactive for one minute

that's the idea

okay so while this

deploys now we can focus on

um couple of other things

yeah so for us to use the data manager

we need to go to this data labeling

and before creating the labeling session

for us to store the data

that we might need to put in into this

labeling session or that that is

exported from this labeling session

we need to have a data set created

so let's go to data sets and

create a new data

will name it training

and click create

so now we have a data set which is empty

and now i'm going to go to data labeling

and i'm going to create the first

tabling session for us

in here

and we need to choose a dataset that's

why i created one early

if you did not create you can create it

from here itself

since we have already done that we can

click on this

and click on create

okay so now you can see the data

labeling session is

being deployed and status is now

available

so this is where we can access the data

manager

so in the meantime we will just have a

peek into my skills

just to see how this is going so it's

still being deployed

that's fine um

so in the meantime we'll go to

data labeling but it's good if you can

stay

until this is deployed

i'm going to pause the video for few

seconds

until this deploys so that we can have a

fresh look

into data manager and see the fields

that we have

okay so now you can see that model has

been deployed successfully and the

status is available

so before getting into data labeling

let's just have a quick look in the

workflow itself

so here i have created a simple workflow

to read some documents that's available

in this folder which is

um right over here

we have 10 documents i'm getting all

that into an error

and i'm taking the text so

going into the taxonomy for this case

i'm expecting these fields

i have the invoice number date to date

and so on along with you

additional fly night

so if you are new to this um and if you

are not sure how to create the taxonomy

i do recommend to go through document

understanding

video series that gives you a very

detailed

idea about how to do it for the time

being

we have created this

so this gives you an idea what we are

trying to do

training and then

i'm using a for each to look through the

documents

and i'm doing the digitization along

with

ui document ocr and

here i have the data extraction

so if someone is wondering why we don't

have the classification

i'm not doing the classification because

for this particular scenario we are only

focused on inputs we don't have multiple

types

so that's why i'm using the data

extraction scope right after

digitizing and

since we don't have the classification

how we are going to say that these are

invoices

by this document type and

from where to type this is actually

coming from the tax name

if i click on here here you can find the

document type id

and copy that and put it here

so i have configured the variables

already

everything i haven't done is adding the

um extractor here in our case we have

the machine learning

audio so let's add

the learning extractor

so you can see once that is added it

asks for

the email skill to do this you need to

have the studio connected to your

orchestrator

once that is connected and easily

configure this thing

so in my case it's already connected and

i'm just clicking on this refresh button

then we'll see the model that we

created earlier i'm going to select that

and provide the api key

and i'm in this enabled update activity

i'm going to click on get capabilities

by doing this we will be getting the

fields that our machine learning module

can extract

okay that is done and let's go to

configure extractors

and right here in this configuration

window

what you see on the left side is

the fields that are coming from the

taxonomy

the fields that we created on the right

hand side you can see

couple of drop downs and these are

coming from the machine learning model

by clicking on that get capabilities

what you did was

you bought all these values from the

model

so in the initial configuration let's

update

before going further i'm going to map

the invoice number

to inverse number date

today um

you did billing address

keeping address so

this is a separate table so we need to

click terms

then it shows the values that you can

get

for this rate quantity

description unit price

and line amount okay these are the

things that our model will

extract right

why i did that is actually to show you

what are the fields that we are focusing

on

training today so you can see though we

are focused on a very limited number of

fields

right over here the model is actually

capable of

extracting more than that but in our

scenario

we will only train for specific set of

fields

as of today

okay now we can get back to aicent

and we earlier created the data labeling

session

now available so i'm going to go

into this enabling session

so now we are in the data manager

so the initial look of the data manager

will

be similar to this just to give you an

idea

we have couple of options here so we'll

be not covering all the things

today but we'll cover some other things

so what you see over here will be your

option to navigate through multiple

documents

on this big area you will see the

document and

here you can see couple of fields the

regular fields

and the column feed so we'll see what

these fields are

so how to configure this we need to do a

bit of configuration here

but it is easy

you just need to follow these steps so

on the first thing

you just need to configure the ocr so

just click on settings button

so by default it is providing us with

the uipath document

but it is also capable of using couple

of other criteria

so nowadays this is the easiest

let's do that so we are using the

document ocr

and the rosia url here

the ocrp is actually our

um document understanding api key

which you can get from the admin page

in my case i have already done it

and let's copy it

make sure i'll go back to admin

and i'm going to licensing over here we

see the

key going into a center

labeling

all right in settings funnel

and this i'm going to place the

hierarchy

and click on save you're not going to do

anything

clicking on save will configure the ocr

engine for

and in a while you will see a small tick

here that says

that has been done yeah

now it is visible so the next step

is to create the regular fields

when you are saying regular fields these

are the fields that we are

extracting through the taxonomy

and if you go back to taxonomy

the fields that we see here the direct

fields

these are the regular fields and what

you see on the line items

are the column wave because these are

coming inside a grid

okay having that in mind

let's get to creating the fields

so now remember we are only focused on

extracting couple of feet

in our case you'll be focusing on

is

this one so

you can see each of these are mapped to

a specific

field in the document order

so let me get this studio on to the

other side of the screen

so i can show you the data manager

while i can see the keys that we need to

extract

okay now the main thing to remember here

is

when you are creating these regular

fields

you are supposed to use the same field

name that we see in the machine learning

model

how to know that is actually by

going through uh that schema for

the one we downloaded so if we open this

here you can see the field name

along with its data type and couple of

other properties

so

so over here let's create our first feed

the one the first one is we need to

create the

invoice number so for invoice number it

is mapped to a field called

cash number we need to use that

so let's copy this one

voice number

over here i'm clicking on regular fields

and i'm pasting that name and clicking

ok now here comes the additional

property

here we see the content type which is

the data type and couple of other

properties

so in our case if we go back to that

json file you can see the type is id

dash number so this is the data type

let's find that in the content

so why we are doing it this way is

because we are

trying to train for existing model

if you are doing this for a totally new

model you can have your own time

but that we will cover in another part

of the video

it is so in this one we need to map it

to the access string structure

and the configuration that they have

done so i'm using the id now

the remaining things i will just keep as

it is

and click on save now you can see

the regulator so likewise we need to

create the other fields the next one is

invoice date clicking on regular field

again

going to the json file

the invoice did is actually captured by

the state

and i'm copying that right

the data type is dead

and i'm not changing anything here click

on one save

the next one is

due date let's find it over here

it's here need to use the same name

otherwise the model will not know to

what fields you're referring to

and clicking on regular fields due date

a dead

and clicking on save

and then comes the billing address

that is over here

filling dash led and now you can see we

have a couple of

other properties called multi line which

is set to true

so this might multi-line means the data

can be

there in the invoice in multiple times

as you know

addresses can span across multiple times

so we need to do that configuration

in regular fields filling address

spring and we need to enable market

and just click on save

the next one is the shipping address

which is right over here the same

configuration

why i have all these fields is actually

to show you

how to do this configuration

so bear with me for this part

next one is reading address

sorry it's a vendetta

because we created the building and for

that

also we need to get the multi line true

have those pins

and lastly we have the total to hold the

total amount of paper

and going down here you can see the

total

and that type is number and it can also

have a multi line

i'm selecting total

and number 39 pro

and set so now we are done with the

regular

similarly we need to do the same thing

for columns

so let's look for the

remaining fields quantity description

unit price and lineup

for this one i'm going to click on

column case

and let's find the quantity over here

and in here here you see the quantity

which is under items

because that falls underline items

and the type is number

and there's another property split items

which is set to true

let's see what that is

i'm going to copy this quantity

type is number and see this split items

let's have a look at the description so

it says

use field as a delimiter between line

items

or rows in table you get the idea

um on any line on which this field

appears

is considered to be a new line

yeah so there's a hint that says most

commonly this is used

in line amount field because that's

usually in invoices that's the last

field in that

rate but in our case this is um

already configured in model so we have

to use

i'm doing that and

clicking cell and that will appear over

here because these are column

so let's quickly do that for the

remaining ones

the next one is description which is

string no additional properties

description string

that is over here and

the next one is unit price

fields unit price that is

number and split items is set to true

and the last column the line amount

and for that as well the number is the

type

and split items is set to true

number items

okay so we have done the configuration

over here and now we are ready to get

documents into this so the next one over

here

create classification yes we'll talk

about this

in another section but i will just

show you a glimpse of so in this json

file

there's a part called classification and

here you can

have any specifications that you need as

for the currency for example

this will talk about later

for now we can ignore this one so

we are coming to this particular step

where we are going to import the

document

so why we are doing this here again

is actually because we are doing the

initial training

uh and this is another way of actually

doing it so that

this same concept is applied when you're

creating a model

or creating a model for that generic

type that you saw in the after the block

packages in that case you will not be

looking into a json file to get these

fields but you will be creating your own

but this is how it is usually done

and one thing to make sure here is you

can see

for these specific fields

you are not adding spaces first phase we

are using a dash

so make sure you do the same thing as a

basis

to have it as one

so let's import some document

how to do that is actually by clicking

on this import

and in here we can import in batches

let's say this is batch one

you can type anything

so that's the option called make this a

test

set so in our case we are trying to

train the model

so we are not making this as a test set

when this mod option is used that

also will cover in another step let's

keep this simple

okay now here we can put the document

so

here is my input files and i'm going to

drag

all these files into this

it will take couple of seconds to import

all the documents now you can see it is

state

same it has 10 files now these are pdf

okay yes

and it will start processing and try to

get

all the documents yes

so you can see also looking into the

ocr engine

this takes couple of seconds

redundant is done

all right so we have imported all 10 w

and you might ask why are we importing

10 of them

can't we do that with 102 documents

so for us to train a model we need to

have at least

10 documents in data menu

that's the minimum requirement that's

why i

imported 10 of you

all right so here we have the documents

you can see none of the fields are

assigned with anything

and say the document is highlighted

uh text and numbers are the ones that

ocr was

captured through this option you can

navigate

to multiple documents

and if you want to delete any document

by clicking on this you can do that

so let's get to the first step

okay this is where we do the initial

labeling

all right so now let's try to add values

to these fields

so you can see something for each and

field there's a key assigned

so this key is actually a shortcut key

so in case we want to add a value to

this invoice number

we need to highlight the value and just

click on the shortcut key

or press it so that it will

add it to the field okay

so in this document the invoice number

is this

so let me highlight and i'm going to

press the i

key the keyboard and you can see it got

a sign

so likewise let's do for this field

the date is this one

so in this case we have three things

identified

i'm going to highlight all three and

press on d

you did same thing pressing on new

now billing address is over here

for this document this is the address

i'm highlighting everything and pressing

e

you can see how easily it is getting at

and for this one

um it's the shipping address

s render address this one

and the total total is right over here

pressing on t

okay now we have done that then we come

to the

column fields

which is this section

so for quantity here we have the value

just as you did earlier select the field

and press on the shortcut

and it will add the value the

description comes next

highlight everything press e

and that is over here right

is the unit price going to be n

and the line amount

l so we are done with this document

so this is how we enable

in data manager

so we can do this automatically as well

through the workflow itself

to the validated data but that is

another video

here i'm going to show you how to do

this in data manager

let's get to the second off

okay so this is a bit of a complicated

one let's see

noise number where is it it's here

i the date is

right over here e do we have a dividend

yep and you

billing address

we don't have a billing address we can

go for shipping address

is this one yes

so in this case we don't have this value

oh i

i'll tell you what will happen to those

kind of feed

so let's first label this whatever we

have

when address will select this one

b and the total is

okay okay so the next thing is

adding values to this polynomial

so in the previous document we simply

did that

by creating it in this way

but over here in this one

here we see a different scenario

here we see the description for each

item

spanning across multiple

so in that case we cannot do it

that easily so we need to do a few

additional

so before adding the items to

quantity description things we need to

group this

entire line

so let's do that so how to group it is

actually by

pressing on this key so

this is in documents uh

docs.you have one.com under documents

here there is option called proof table

row

so after you have labeled some fields

and only if some rows span multiple

lines

next then you may need to group this

using this key that's what we are trying

to do

let's go back so remember this

is a slash so i'm coming

here and i'm going to say that this

entire line

belongs to a single row

i'm going to highlight this entire thing

and pressing on that key which is

this one i'm going to highlight it

now you can see as soon as i press it

this entire thing got highlighted in

green

this means this entire thing is a single

row

now let's add the values

now the quantity i'm going to only

select on the quantity

inside this group is three and press on

q

so it's getting added over here and

then the description so for description

this particular portion highlighting

that

and pressing e you can see it

got added the same line

same thing goes for unit price which is

n

and the line amount is l

let's do that for the remaining part

okay to highlight this entire thing

with by pressing the special grouping

key

and 4 goes to

quantity is the second line

this part goes to description

n and f

so it's easy same thing goes here

right

pressing on the special key

and here we have one as the quantity

as part as the description

and

here we have the line

okay so this is how we label

multiple lines let's get to the

third document we need to keep on doing

this for all the documents

so i'll just show you this for a couple

of

documents and the remaining part i will

just

um so that you won't be too bored

listening to me uh

okay so let's quickly do this one

here we have a different scenario so

that's why i want to show it so we have

the invoice number

i uh

e that's the due date

billing address yeah

here's the billing address which is

keeping address

yes vendor address is this one

total goes

all right so in this case here you have

a single line of description and

multiple line of this

so can we do the same thing we did

earlier

yeah actually for both lines we can so

let's do it

here i'm going to show you how to group

this thing

i'm going to highlight this entire row

and i will press on that special key

hash

so this entire line will get highlighted

in screen

and here goes the quantity q

price is the unit price which is um

n and l

i'm find out in this section and this

goes to

this one line so quickly going to the

second one

highlighting i row

grouping it quantity goes as q

the description

and the unit price and

this is l okay

so that also we have done

okay so let me show you another special

scenario

which is in this one so after this

i promise i won't board you too much i

should do it

uh and show it to you at the end

let's quickly do this one

this is the invoice number where is it

i hate you that

uh which is you

okay so in this case

let's say you don't have the billing

address and this is only the shipping

address

and see so

in my case i don't want the value

address

to be added to this thing so

how can i remove that i cannot select

values individually just like we

are able to do in the validation step

so in this case we can what we can do is

so this is what i wanted to show you

in this document so in this case we will

highlight this entire section

and i'm going to press s to add this

thing to

address and you can see the

value address is also there i want to

remove this

we can easily do that just select

on it and by right clicking it you can

see this has been assigned to shipping

address

what i'm doing is selecting it and

pressing my

delete key and you can see

it got updated automatically this is how

you remove unwanted stuff

from your fg and you can do the same

thing over here

see here it's a bit more complicated

so the address starts from here

and it ends somewhere over here let's

highlight this entire section

and i'm going to add this to e

i'm going to remove this you can see

those are already added

village delete

and i don't need the phone number and

that's

it you can see the updated one

okay so that's how we do the tabling

so let me do the remaining labeling

offline and i'll start the video deposit

here

and i'll start it after

completing the labeling stuff

give me a couple of seconds

all right so i have done the

labeling for all the 10 documents i have

grouped

all the lines even for the single line

ones

so let's now

try to export this how to do that is

actually

by um clicking on this

export button

all right so since we have done all this

let's import

so make sure you need to have at least

10 documents

to export right let's

try to export now remember when we

created this

uh data labeling session

it has its own data set so whatever we

export now

we'll go and save in the data set we go

to data set

as of now this is something that it has

created automatically

install some internal data

when the session got created so

let's export it now export tagged

data okay

so now exporting you need to make sure

you won't enter any capital or space

values just simple i will say

initial

i want to extract all the labels

select that and click on export

you can also download this as and

for now we'll just do the expo

when x14 you can see this flashing

and here we have a message

that says the following fields are

labeled in less than tender

each which is the field billing address

all the fields as hidden or delete them

or tag them in at least 10 dollars yeah

so if we see we marked all the documents

but this billing field billing address

is not available in all the documents

that's why

i mentioned that it needs to be there in

at least 10

so either we need to have at least 10

documents that has this value

or else if we want to export this for

training

with the current data set what we can do

is

[Music]

we need to hide this field id

means go to edit

and click on this hidden hide

you can see the description hide field

when exporting itself

click that and click on save that will

apply for all the document

and you can see this hidden

okay let's try to export

that's it

i mistakenly added capital

and

this time you should see it's flashing

give it a couple of seconds

yeah so the flashing stopped that means

we have exported successfully going back

to ai center

and let's refresh this data

refreshing and now you can see a folder

called export

like this here it is

here is our export initial export demo

inside this one you see the theme

adjacent you see the split csv that got

created

and images contains all the

files processed

and a test contains the json version of

the

file right so this is what we need

to train our model

so we created this through the data

manager

every single thing we labeled it through

the data manager

so in case of

when we are building models i am telling

this time

time just repeat myself so that

on the same page

when we are creating models from scratch

even on that generic model

this is the way to do it so we can train

it initially based on

some samples then you can do the

training through the

retraining activities that we'll talk

about

later in another week how to do that

part

again data manage is involved but we

will not be labeling

you will just be verified

that's a topic for another video

since we have this stuff over here and

let's

now try to upgrade this

let's train it so we need to go to

pipelines

right and we need to

do a full training run not a full

pipeline run

we are doing a full training run which

is

this option and i'm going to select my

current version

listen this so my inner version we have

was

and choosing the data now

this is the data set that we created

initially

but while we were doing the labeling it

created couple of

other additional folders inside we are

not interested in this

internal we only want to go inside this

export

and this is what we are interested

initial export

the one that we gave the name we need to

select that

and we we'll have the auto retraining

things false by default value for now

talk about these things later in another

and i'm going to click create while

having the option run now

so this is going to create a training

pipeline which will train our model

so this is packaging as of now it's

going to take some time

so let's have a try i'll get back to you

this is gone i'm going to pause the

video

okay uh so now you can see

the the model that we created

it has it has successfully

completed and

the previous version was 11.0

and if we go inside this we'll go to my

skills

if we go inside this one we can now see

the latest version

1.1 which is the one we trained and

created so how to upgrade

as of now you can see it's using the

version 11.0

by default so you can easily upgrade by

clicking on this button over here

just click on it so you can see

the current version is this and u1 will

be this one

just confirm so

again this will take couple of minutes

just to complete

but after that your workflow should be

ready to work on the new

and the trend model

so this is how you

train your ml models using

data manager this is one way of doing it

so

just to summarize what we did is through

data manager

we created the labels we mapped

everything

and we trained

so the other way to do this

is instead of mapping all of these

things manually

we can do that while the process runs

so through the validation part after

extraction

those information can be captured and

we can feed that information into data

manager

and we will not be doing any labeling

after that

unless it's really needed uh

so that's how that's the other way of

doing it so

you capture it through your process

itself and

push it to the ai center and train your

model

so that part we'll look at in the part

two of the video

and this one basically

this is what we covered so this is

purely focused on how we can use the

data manager to label

and you know train the models

okay so and we tried this for invoices

in the second one we will also look at

the part now we can do the same thing

for that

generic model so it's kind of the same

concept

but if you remember we went through the

json file but next time we'll be

just creating our own food okay

so i hope this was a

good informative one for you i hope it's

not boring

because we have to do a lot of labeling

while you guys are watching

anyway um so thank you for watching

hope this was useful and uh

it was helpful for you to understand how

to do the labeling over here

thanks again and i'll see you in another

video until then

take care
