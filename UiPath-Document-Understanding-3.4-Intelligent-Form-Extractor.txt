hello welcome to the part 3.4

of data extraction and in this section

we will take a look at

how we are going to extract handwritten

data

from a document so how we can do that

is before

looking into that let's take a look at

the document that we are going to use so

i have already

shared some of the samples with you

so in this you can see we have some

handwritten information

which we can try to extract

so for that

um in the workflow we last

did is the retex based extractor

and in this one to extract handwritten

data we are going to use the

intelligent form extractor

so we can search that here

this is much more similar to the form

extractor

only different says this is mainly used

to extract

handwritten data

the rest how you configure creating

templates

identifying fields everything is same as

the form extractor

so here you have to change the end point

since we are using the trial

as you see over the form extractor it

says addition equals enterprise

we have to do the same thing over here

as well

so i can simply change it

because enter twice

and then as you know in this series we

are going to take the api key

from uh asset

and we are going to convert it using

this code so i can just copy and paste

and then we are going to go for manage

templates

the first thing is we need to create a

template

and we are going to select the account

creation form

so this we created in the taxidermy at

the beginning of the series

and we can give any name

creation

and then i have to select the pdf file

so

it could be a video it would be a image

can be anything

so in this folder i'm going to use this

particular document

and then i will say configure so that it

will automatically

digitize and give me a screen

to provide the identify the fields

so it will take couple of seconds

so ideally it's asking for native video

format but if you don't have a native

video still it's fine

okay so this is the template manager

and you get some instructions over here

which can be helpful

and now the first thing is as you

already aware of this we first need to

provide a set of keywords

to identify the page so i can

highlight the first parts and take the

tokens and

edit as the matching info

and then it's the application type so

this is a boolean

type as we defined in the taxonomy

so what we are trying to do here is we

need to identify whether this

is a new application or whether there is

an update

so the assumption here is if you find a

tick

in the new box that means it's a new

application

if not it's an update

so all you need to do is you need to

highlight

this area just like you did in the

form extractor and get the custom area

and add it to application type

so all the phase over here are expecting

handwritten data

and we need to highlight only the

handwritten

parts of it and the next one is

application date

so i'm ignoring the printer text and

will extract only the

written part get the custom area

and edit so all the time we are not

taking the tokens you will always get

the

higher written the custom area because

the

tokens might differ and do that for

cif number

and the account number

and next is the name of the entity which

you can identify

over here so i will

highlight this part

so you see two lines available so i will

give

line by line and i will highlight this

area

and add it

and i will highlight this second line

separately

and add it as an additional fit

so when this executes it will combine

these two and give you the final result

as we did in the form extractor

and the place of incorporation is over

here

so i'm going to highlight that and the

custom area is going to

be placed over here and this is the

address

so for address we have couple of fields

so we'll give one by one

this is the first one

and then will be the second

and third one

and the district

so all this will combine and give you

the final result

we just need to provide the fields

and finally the fourth quarter

okay so we have copper phase for that

and we can use these as well let's give

it a try

to see how it works

okay and we are done with the

template and this same template will be

applied to the other document as well

because it's the same

uh thing we are going to use so let's

save it

and then if you have any signature field

so if you have any

page that you're going to check whether

a signature is available

or not you can highlight or

select that over here and it will give

you a boolean result saying whether the

signage is available

or not and then

out of all those fields it's asking what

are the handwritten things

and in our case all the phases are

handwritten

so i will select all

and the next thing is here

it says boolean field interpretation

so that we already have a boolean field

where you can

see either a take or

any identification for that so we can

add some

common recommended values by clicking on

this as you see

at the ears x b or the take

anything to identify whether it's

uh years or no in our case to identify

whether there is a new application or

not

for no it's not really needed as of now

because we are only looking at one

particular field so

let's ignore the node

and this is my configuration

so let's close this

and we are done with the intelligent

form extractor

next thing is to add it in the

extractor configuration so we have

account creation form and we have all

the fields

over here and i'm going to use

integration from

extractor for all of those so i don't

need to select one by one i can simply

select

the first line so it will get applied to

all the fields

and just click on save

so that's it

in terms of configuration so let's run

it and see

how these actually work and let's see

the output

of this i'm going to save it

and run

you can see it's executing on the left

hand side

and we get the folder selection

so i'm going to select my folder

samples

so in that folder we have

two files two similar files so

let's see how the output is going to be

and since it's the image you can see the

ocr is executing

and now we should see the validation

station you can see the intelligent form

extractor

okay so we have the first validation

screen

let's see our output and

here you can see it has properly

identified the tick

based on our configuration with 99

confidence

and the debt is exactly the same

and the same number

uh is anything different no

and the account number

yeah it's almost the same and over here

we have

virginia and lt

i'm not sure from where that came from

but you can see that

it's highlighting both lines which we

marked separately and added as

additional field

so it has extracted the value

so i'll just remove this since it's not

required

the place of incorporation you can see

the output

and let's see the address

so you can see it has extracted values

from all these fields that we have

identified

and over here

it says two one zero mill bay str

and i'm not sure what this

is

so so the thing is with handwritten data

sometimes

i might need to do a little bit of

formatting around it

so that's fine yes but it gives you

a good level of accuracy so i can simply

remove this part

and you see the california los angeles

and ca and it has identified all that

properly and for us it says

45 in a way it looks like 45

but let's see us

and it gets updated over here as well

okay so that looks fine

and let's see how our other document

looks like

this is the second one

again it has properly identified this it

says

yes the data is captured the numbers are

properly identified

this is a little bit different report is

there

i'm not sure where the key came from

just remove it

usa is properly identified and this

address is

a little bit different

uh okay so as i said we need some sort

of

cleansing on this stuff

but still you can actually get

most of the data extracted as you see

okay let me clear this

right so that's

how we can use the intelligent form

extractor

to extract handwritten data with

slight uh cleansing that's always

expected when it comes to handwritten

data

so the good thing here is we get the

confidence level of each and every field

and as you might have seen earlier this

confidence level was

uh somewhere around 10 because it has

some

weird characters

so being the

we as we complete this the extraction

part of this series

next is the validation

so how we do the validation how can we

use this confidence

level that we see in the validation

stations

to actually decide whether we need

manual verification

or not that's what we are going to cover

in our next video so

stay tuned and this is one of the most

important

topics because when it comes to

data extraction and validation we are

not expecting

the user to sit there and validate each

and every document

so we need to identify ways of

validating without human intervention

and to decide

when we need human intervention so

that's what we are going to cover next

and stay tuned until then explore the

intelligent form extractor and see

what else we can do with it

and just explore some of these fields

over here

and see what sort of output that you get

thank you very much see you in the next

video
