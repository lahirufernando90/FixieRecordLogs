hi i'm rahul fernando i'm a uipath mvp

a community leader and a solution

architect

in today's video we'll be discussing

about the uipath

diagnostic tool why do we need a

diagnostic tool and why do we

check for errors there

are scenarios where we come across

different system errors

due to this installation issues

or issues when connecting the ufo studio

with the orchestrator

or the robot with the orchestrator and

even sometimes

errors specific to a different projects

that we are working on

to identify such errors and get the

technical support

that's needed we might need to extract

the log files

uh related to studio or the execution

and log files related to the project

registry values that we need to look at

and the environment variables

process information licensing

basically a lot of information that's

needed

because for them to troubleshoot they

need to understand

how our environment is set up

so how can we extract this information

easily is through the diagnostic tool

ui path offers a diagnostic tool which

is

a standalone utility which you can

actually download and install through

the cloud platform

so in this cloud platform if you go into

resource center

under other products you can easily find

the diagnostic tool

which you can download and install

however

this tool is also automatically

installed by your

while you're installing the community

edition

so you can access that through the start

menu

by typing diagnostic

so this tool looks similar to

what you see on the screen now

basically we have to go through four

simple steps

to extract the information we need

so when we are talking about the

diagnostic

data extraction of those log files of

the environment

and so on we are looking at

four different profiles

first one is the studio robot activities

issue

so this option always looks at the

studio

robot or the activity related issues

basically it's mainly focusing on the

log files created by the studio and

and by the execution logs

the next option the orchestrator issue

is

looking at gathering information about

your connection to the orchestrator

so each of these two

profiles comes with a specific

data collection options which we'll look

at

a little in a little while this

empty profile option which we have is

to customize our profile

based on the data that we need to

extract

according to our requirement and then

last option is specific to a project

so what you can do is you can select the

project

json file of the project that you need

to extract

the logs of the

error information you can specify the

project json file

and extract the information related to

that particular project

so let's check one by one

if we select the studio robot and

activities

and click on next it will go to the

configuration option

so over here you are looking at

different collection

methods the first one registering for

it will basically extract the register

keys

used as well as the values resp

assigned to each and every key

screen information will extract the

information about the displays you are

using

in the machine so basically if you have

multiple displays

it will include all that information

along with the resolution

and some other information which we can

look at

in a little while

and it will also include the logs

created by applications and as well as

by the system

so by default application is the option

that's selected

and it will also extract the computer

related information

and environment variables log files

process information

so these are referring to the system

process

and if there are any any other third

party application that's being used

those will be uh

extracted in this one and if you have

any other

ui path related installations

basically ui path products installed

that

information will be also extracted

the next option is the licenses so it

will basically extract the

license that you are using

and finally you will have the settings

file if you are using

any apart from that you can also include

any other information that's

needed for your extraction

and once you have selected everything

that you need

you can click on the collect button

this will extract the information and it

will give you a preview

so that you can look at the sample data

that's being extracted

so let's give it a couple of seconds to

extract the information

right so for register information it has

extracted

some values related to the uipath robot

studio and the activities

so it's by default showing only three

but you can always click

on this area so that you can look at all

the values that it's extracting

and scrolling down in my machine i have

two displays

so that's why it's showing the displays

that i'm already using

so in here we specified we need

application logs and here it's

extracting that information into a

different file

in a dot evtx format

and this is my computer information

along with the operating system

the version the current desktop

and the administrator login and if i'm

using any global proxy

that will be mentioned here

apart from that if i'm using a remote

session

that will be captured as well

and the next one is the environment

variables

so in here you can actually check what

kind of environment variables i'm using

related to uipath

robot and studio

and when it comes to log files it will

basically extract

all the execution logs and the log file

is created by the studio

and you can see here that it's

extracting information from 141

execution logs and 264

studio logs

you can also click on these links so

that it will open

another window where you can actually

select and

open this particular file and if not if

you

think that you don't need this

information for your diagnostic

you can deselect them

by simply clicking on this checkbox

so i will enable that for now and click

ok

and similarly you can see the same

screen for studio logs

and scrolling down we have any if you

have any other combined logs those will

be included here

as well and that will be shown in a

different window

next is the process related information

so it will basically show the process

that are already running

and scrolling down again we will be

looking at the.net framework

the default browser we are using and if

there are any other browsers

that we have installed and used those

information will be stored here as well

and the antivirus software is also

mentioned because sometimes the

antivirus software is

blocking certain services from executing

so it's always good to know what kind of

antivirus software that we are using

apart from that if you are using any

other software all that information is

captured

and the next one is the uipath

installers so if we are using different

software provided by uipath all that

information is captured here along with

the version

and the installation path

next one is the license it will

basically include the license

information and finally if you have a

settings file

that information will be shown here

since i'm using the community version i

have the community settings

in this particular location

so you can always access that by just

clicking on the link provided

and there are a few other information

like studio two settings

the nougat configurations

and also if there are any other

installation configuration that needs to

be done

all that will be mentioned

and finally the connection to your

orchestrator

that information will also be provided

and finally to extract this information

what you can do is you can just click on

next and it will show you the summary of

what

information is being extracted and once

you click on export

it will extract that information into a

zip file

and save it in a specific location

so let me save it in my

downloads

okay

so while we look at that

extracted information little later

let's explore the other options

in the orchestrator issue you can see

that

the number of collections are

different so it's collecting information

related to that specific

profile basically the information needed

to identify how the connection is being

made between the orchestrator

and the robot or the computer

so if you have the orchestrator

installed that information will also be

mentioned here

and when it comes to the empty profile

you can decide

what information that you need to

extract you just simply need to select

the information that you need and it

will

have the same screen as you saw earlier

and that information will be

extracted so if i select these three

and click on collect

let's give it a couple of seconds

yeah you are seeing the same screen as i

as we saw earlier

all that information is captured and

will be shown here so let's get back

and the final option is extraction

of the diagnostic data based on a

specific

project so all you need to do is select

a specific project

a json file and

go through the same setup options

so now since we have looked at the

diagnostic tool

let's see what kind of data it extracted

so i'll be extracting this information

so basically it has a lot of data

yeah so the extracted data will look

something similar to what you are seeing

on screen now

so the data collectors json file will

contain

the information related to the

collectors and the results

basically the same information we saw in

that

diagnostic tool so all that information

will be listed here

and in the settings file it will include

all the settings

files that were shown through the

diagnostic tool

in the log files we will have all the

execution logs

this blocks related to the studio

and any other logs that are included

finally the application logs will

include all the application

event logs that's extracted from your

computer event logs

so once you have extracted all this

information you can

pass that data to the technical support

team

so that they can go through your logs

and other information

and do the troubleshooting to easily

identify

the issue and rectify it

so that's the end of the

tutorial on the diagnostic tool

thank you very much and see you in the

next video
