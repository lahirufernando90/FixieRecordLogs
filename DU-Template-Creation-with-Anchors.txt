hello everyone welcome to

my new video on document template

creation

with anchors in uipath document

understanding

so this feature was introduced in the

latest

release of uipath

so as you guys know for us to create

templates in uipath for document

understanding we use

the form extractor or the intelligent

form extractor

in case you need to do for handwritten

data so we use the same

two activities to create

the template with anchors so

anchoring is the new feature that was

introduced

so let's see how we can use this

in uipath to get more accurate data

when we are working with um

fixed structure documents

but the challenge is when it comes to

these documents sometimes

though you have the same layout just

like

what you see in this document sometimes

you might

come across these documents are

different in size

or it is flipped to the other side of

the page just like what you see over

here

now this is the same document but

it's rotated around

and again you might come across

especially when you are working with

scanned documents

the size might differ be different some

time to time

so this is the same document with a

different size

and this is as an image also

you might also come across situations

where

the same scanned document is

not in that proper layout

so sometimes it might be tilted a little

just like what you see here so usually

this happens when you're scanning

so in this case how can we use the form

extractor

with the anchors to capture

the information irrespective of the size

of the document

of how it is placed in the document

so as you know earlier this form

extractor it was

when you specify a range or a custom

area

it used to look for that value in that

way

but now it is a little bit more advanced

so that

we can use the same template in this

kind of scenarios as well

so let's see how we can do that

so here we are in the uipath studio

now i'm not going to build the entire

flow from scratch

so i have the basic things ready here

as you see uh i'm using the

so let me show you the dependencies so

if i go to project dependencies you can

see that i'm using the

very latest version of the document

understanding mail activities

and the latest version of intelligent

ocr

activities so

use the latest version and in here

i have pointed this to the folder path

where i have

my input files

which is right here so these are the

files that you saw earlier

and it is specified here in the

folder part and i have done the

load taxonomy so taxonomic creation is

just the same as before

so you have all these fields

and these are

the things that i have used to actually

show you how this works

so no difference in taxonomic creation

you just need to specify the field and

the data type and that's it

so after the low taxonomy you go into

the forage

to look through each and every page the

document

and in the digitized document activity

i have used the uipath document ocr

and when it comes to data extraction

code scope

i'm not using the classification here

because of that

i'm using the document type id

which i can grab from the taxonomy

manager

so if i go into this section here you

see the document type id

so in case you are not familiar with

these activities how you should do this

i actually recommend you to

go through the video series that you can

find in my

youtube channel or you can go to your

path academy

and look for the document understanding

courses available there

okay so in the data extraction scope

i have the variables assigned and i'm

using the form extractor here

this is the activity that we need to use

to create templates

so in my case i'm actually using the

enterprise trial

so the end point as you see it is

pointed

to the enterprise

endpoint if you are using the community

this part will not be there

okay and you need to space the api key

and let's

create the template so though i have the

activity i have not yet created the

template so let's create one

clicking on create template selecting

the type as invoices

and i'll be giving a name

nice and since we have like

four documents here let's create the

template

for the first document which is

this one this is the native pdf file

the rest are actually images as you see

and this one as well so let's create the

template for this document and let's see

how it applies

to all the other variants

so i'm selecting the document here

as the first one

and i'll leave these things as it is

click ok

and here now you can see in the latest

version there are few

additional

icons here which specify few things

also this icon says that it accepts

custom areas

it was there earlier and this anchor

kind of

i can specifies that it also accepts

anchors for each and every field

so this anchoring concept is actually

similar to

the anchors that we use when we are

doing ui automation

um so if you are using the anchor base

activity in ui automation

you can specify your anchor and

also the element that you are

interacting so it's kind of the same

thing

in here we'll be also using a target

that focus on the value that we need to

extract

and also we'll be specifying one or more

anchors for each and every

element or the target to easily identify

that

so along with this on the top here

you can see another selection mode

here we have tokens customer customer

area

choice on selection and also anchor

tokens

is these uh

elements that we can capture and when

you specify custom area

you can specify an area like this

and choice on selection is

so you can see once i select that

i can either select tokens or the entire

custom area

so in our case let's use the anchor

but first first we need to specify

matching info

in the first page so

by default you need to have at least

five words here

so let's give

i see i'm pressing the ctrl key while

selecting

it allows me to create multiple words

and maybe this this set

so let's do that and also

from here and clicking on plus

and that goes as the matching info

and we are coming to the invoice date

so in the previous version we only

specified the custom

area now we can do the anchor

we can actually specify the area and

along with that we can specify

anchor based on these identifiers

in the document so to do that

select invoice state

and go to anchor the first thing you

need to do is

find the value so for the invoice date

we will specify

this as our value all you need to do is

just

highlight the area where you can find

the value

you can see it is highlighting in blue

color

and you can see it's as a target

and you can also have see the delete

button

you click on that it deletes

so let's highlight this

and this is what i need to extract

and how am i going to specify the anchor

is

it's always better to specify a

element something closer to the

target but use something

unique here i don't recommend using

any other values as the anchor

but use the identifiers here it is

always the same

so once you specify this

just drag on top of this

to specify the anchor so you can see it

is highlighting in

green color just like in ui automation

and it has a link saying that this

anchor is related to this tab

so once you do that click on this plus

sign

and you can see this

was configured and also it has one micro

and the main anchor is the date

if you have multiple anchors this will

have

several anchors specified here

the next thing is the invoice number

so let's do the same thing for that and

i'm

selecting the invoice number and also

these two as the anchor

and click on class again

the next is due date select on due date

and i'm specifying the

udate along with

my anchor so you can see while

highlighting it

also highlights the

words in in the region in green color

for the anchor

the next is the delivery address

so let's use this one so first thing is

the value and i can use this

as the anchor

okay and the last one here

total so let's give two anchors for the

total

and i need to select that first

and then highlight the value

and let's give balance due and payment

as

the two anchors so i'll give the

closest one and this is going to be the

main anchor

and along with that i will specify

payments as a secondary

so you can see how it links the main

anchor is linked to the

target and the secondary anchor is

linked to the main anchor

and when i click on plus you can see the

two anchors

main anchor with the blue color

icon and the other with the black

so that's how you do the anchoring

so let's also configure the line items

here

so in the latest one it is actually easy

some of these features were already

there so i will extract a new table

and if it is able to identify the

columns

and the rows it will automatically

separate it out so i just need to

separate the columns here

and i need to specify item number

description quantity so these are coming

from the taxonomy

uh unit price and this column is not

required so i will say

unused and

final and then i will say

um extract header and set

so now you see four rows here but i only

have

three including the header

so this is the header as you see

it also highlights in red line here

so let's make this as

the make it the table header

so this will now

relate to the column header

and this is the first line second answer

so let's remove this as we don't need

the third one

okay answer so we have configured

the template along with the anchors

and let's click on save

and close configure the extractor

for all the fields so i have done that

earlier

so after doing this down here i have

the present validation station which is

configured to

show us the values that were extracted

and below i have the export extraction

results

to extract or convert the extractor

results into a

more usable format into a data set so

that i can

write it into excel file

so the main thing we are focused here in

this video is

use of the form extractor so in case you

have

uh handwritten data instead of the form

extractor

use the intelligent form instructor and

you

follow the same steps

okay so we have done that for the main

document

the first document so let's run this and

see

how it applies to the other

layouts or basically the other type of

documents where you have it

as a horizontal one and you know

smaller scale and also

uh in this kind of documents

which is a bit uh different

compared to this one so let's see how it

works

okay so i'm going to run this

okay so the validation station for the

first document so this is our main

document

the same document that we use to create

the template

so you can see it is extracting the

values as usual

no much reference here and this is

missing

so i'll save it and continue and let's

see

so this is this should obviously be

accurate because we use the same

document for the template creation

the challenge is how does it work in the

other

documents because the values are not in

the same

position it was as in the main document

okay so the next one is ah

sorry i had to drag it to this screen

because it opens up

in my other screen so this is the

document that

has the same layout in a smaller scale

which is our second document this one

so here you can still see that

though the size of this is different

it is still able to capture the values

using the template and it is

highlighting the same values

but here in the invoice number you can

see it is saying

go here and it is this

but along with that so this feature is

also coming in as a

new feature in the latest release so you

can see

three here and it says so

show suggestions so let's click on that

and see what's there

okay so here we see three options

one is go here which is the one already

selected along with the confidence level

and if you say footer it is pointing to

this one

and if i select the value

this one which is exactly the one

that i need to extract so

how this is ordered is based on the

confidence level

so go here has the highest confidence

but

this is the one that i need to extract

but it is

showing here as a suggestion so it's

good

so for me to select this as the accurate

one you just need to click on this

replace value with suggestion

and there you go so the due date is

correct and the address

is it has captured as usual

let's see the line items so that is also

captured

irrespective of the size for the layout

so you can see now that the template is

more flexible

and it doesn't need to be the exact same

way

but the intel structure has to be the

same but

how it is placed in the document can

differ

so let's save this and move to the next

level

so in the next document we should get

the

one that is uh

yeah so this one you can see there's a

difference

so this is the third document you can

see three

which is

this document so this is how it is in

the original document

it is on a

horizontal basis but the

document understanding was able to

uh

rotate it so that it comes in

in this format and still you can see

that it was able to apply the same

template

to capture the values that i need

and those are really accurate

even the line items

okay so let's see the other document

which is this one which is

um so usually we come across these kind

of documents when you are working with

documents because sometimes

you won't place the document in the

exact same way

yeah so this is that document and again

you can see though it is it

not very aligned still it

applies the same template to capture the

values

so we have the invoice that we have the

invoice number

and the address let's see the line items

so you can see it is capturing

everything perfectly

so that's really amazing

and this is how you should or you can

use

the anchors along with the form

extractor

by creating templates to work on

fixed structure documents but how it is

placed

or where it is placed in the document

can change now

so it is more easier to work with

and to make things even easier you can

create

more than one template for the same big

structure document

to address more

variated scenarios or more variances

on how it is placed in the document for

the page

so this is how easy

it is now to create templates and use it

um so i hope this is helpful

to understand how we can use the anchors

to create

the templates using the form extractor

i will share this solution in the video

description

so that you can download and try

yourself

and thank you very much for listening

hope this is helpful

see you in another video until then

enjoy
