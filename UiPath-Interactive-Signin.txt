hello i'm nahiru

so today i'm connecting with you guys to

share some knowledge about one of the

latest features

that you have introduced with the 20.8

preview release

which is the interactive sign-in

so what's exactly the interactive sign

in

that's a new feature that your path

introduced so that you can

connect your uipath assistant

using the same login that you are

logging into the cloud platform

so that all the available features

in the entire uipath platform will be

available

in the uipath system for example

if you have new data services created or

data entities created in the data

services

all those will be available in the

uipath assistant itself

so that through uipath studio you can

connect to those services and access

what you have created over there

so as you all know as of now we are

connecting

the uipath assistant through the machine

key but the new feature is

instead of using the machine key we can

use

the same login that we are using to

login to the cloud platform to connect

the ui path assistant with one of the

robots available in the orchestrator

so how exactly to do that is

what i am going to show you so we need

to go through a few configuration steps

to enable that

so let me show you

so first this is the new ui path

assistance screen

which came up with the 20.8 preview

so as of now i have connected with the

machine key

so let's disconnect it for now you can

go to preferences

and go to orchestrator settings and i'll

be disconnecting

okay now here you have two options one

is a service url and one is the machine

key so service url is the new

interactive sign-in feature

where you will be connecting to the

orchestrator

through the orchestrator url the same

url that you are using

to connect using the machine key

so before setting it up we need to go

into the orchestrator to

do some configurations

so once you get into the orchestrator so

i'm using the new design

you can get to the old design

through this option as well or if you

are using the old design you can get to

the

new design through the same option so

you will have a

new option there so all you need to do

is

you need to go to the tenant

and get to settings

and once you get into security

once you scroll down you'll see two new

check boxes over here

that says enable use authentication in

assistant

so you just need to enable this and

click on save

so that your assistant can use

your credentials to connect

with the orchestrator so once you have

configured this

next option is you need to have a robot

to the same user that you are connecting

it

so earlier what we had is we had a

separate robot

that actually we that we configure

through for that particular folder under

robots we configure the normal user

normal robot that we used previously

so this now robot is not going to work

when you are connecting through the

interactive sign in

because a user is the one who is logging

in

and there has to be a robot assigned

specifically for that user

so this is a separate robot that works

on different

aspects so what you have to do is you

need to

get to the tenant again because we need

to create a robot for that particular

user

you have to get to users

in this screen you will see this user

that you are logging in

to the orchestrator or the cloud

platform

so once you have selected the user

you can check the robot access over here

the column this has to be enabled

so as of now i have enabled that but

initially this will be disabled if you

have not configured it so if it is

disabled all you need to do is

go to edit

and get to attended robot

so this is where the new feature

that came in some time back where you

can

create automatically new robots for each

and every user that you configure in the

orchestrator

so it's the same feature that we are

connecting

through the interactive sign-in all you

need to do is you need to give the

domain and the username that you are

logging into the

machine just like previously that you

did once you go into the command prompt

and type cmd

sorry if you go to command prompt by

typing cnt

you can say who am i and that will give

you the domain and the username so

it's the exact same old steps that we

used you can

copy that and paste it over here

and for the license type you need to

select studio pro

because the interactive sign in works

with studio pro license

so once you have selected that and

leave the unattended as it is because

this is the attended feature and under

gender is not going to work over there

and get to robot settings enable

whatever the features that you

need to enable and also enable auto

download tracers

and set it as yes and then click on

update

so it will take a little bit of time

like few seconds

to create the new robot for this

particular user

and once it is created

you should see a green color

uh message saying it sucks

saved successfully like this and this

data should be enabled

and once you go to your tenant again and

click on robots

you should see the new robot

over here saying studio pro floating

and the provision type is modern

but the status is disconnected because

we need to connect

through the assistant now so once you

have covered all these steps

get back to the assistant

over here and select the service url

from the orchestrator settings

and for the service url you need to give

the same url

that you are using for the orchestrator

so basically if you go to the

orchestrator

the file path the url starting from

this portion of the url you have to copy

it

and paste it over here so i have already

done that

so i'll be using that so you can see the

same url and click on sign in

this will open up a new web page

so my default browser is something else

in this form you just need to select

so basically you will be prompted to

sign in just like you

usually do when you're signing into the

cloud platform so just give the

username and password for that

particular user

and if you have multiple organizations

select the one that you need to connect

to so i'll be using this one

and to complete the login you just click

on continue

and then you will see the status over

here

so it will take few seconds

now you can see the green color status

it says robot is connected to

orchestrator

and if you click on profile you can see

my name

and you have the sign out option

so we can get back to the orchestrator

and now if you check the tenant and

robust page

you can see that this robot is available

so that's how the interactive sign-in

feature

works so once you connect to

this robot that you created

you can get to the studio and

use this small option down here

if you have the studio already open and

click on

refresh so that it will refresh all the

resources available in the cloud

platform for you and

the studio will get all the available

resources that you have

so in the resources panel you can see

that

all the available data services

you have access to those now and

the assets queues and processes that you

had earlier

all those will be visible along with the

data services

that you have created if you have the

data services enabled

and from here onwards all these all the

process that you create

will be executed by the

new robot that you created and the good

thing about the interactive

sign-in is that

when you are logging out from the

machine

or the

when you're logging logging out from the

interactive sign-in it will

sign out completely basically you will

be

signed up from the cloud platform and it

will

disconnect both the user profile and the

machine

key connection from the assistant

or from the orchestrator what is the

difference

with the machine key and the interactive

sign in connection

is that when you're logging out from ui

path assistant

after being logged via mission key it

disconnects the user profile

but the robot stays connected in the

interactive signing

both get disconnected so that's the

difference

so that it's kind of like a personalized

experience

so you'll be working with one login and

if someone wants to

use the same machine to run one of their

processes that are specific to them you

can

disconnect the robot from that we are

login and he can connect

through the through his login

and do whatever task is he needs to do

so that's the simple introduction for

our

interactive sign-in feature you can also

go to docs.uft.com and

so thank you and see you in another

video

have a good day
