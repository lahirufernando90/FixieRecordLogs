hello welcome to part 4 of the advanced

ui path document understanding video

series

so in this series we'll be taking a look

at

how we can validate the extracted data

based on the confidence

level so

uh as of now we have been

doing a lot of validations or data

extractions using the data extraction

scope

and we did extractions on

multiple fields using different

extractors so

until now we only focused on using a

present validation station

irrespective of how the traffic

extraction took place

so today we will see how we can use this

uh change the same workflow to introduce

the confidence level

so what i'm going to do is

i will just minimize this

so as you know from data extraction

scope we are getting an

output called automatic extraction

data and i'm going to use this variable

to check the confidence

before that i'm going to

change this the intelligent ocr package

to the latest version

because some of some new releases were

there

during the past couple of weeks so i'll

update

that

to show you how we can use the latest

features

okay so to export these

results we need to use the export

extraction resource

activity which you can find

once you search for export it will be

there under intelligent ocr

so i'm going to use it uh

somewhere here before that i'll just add

a new sequence

if you think that this is too much for

this particular workflow you can

simply do another workflow and

invoke it as we did here for this

specification

but for now i will show it here itself

and in this sequence i will place this

particular activity and i'm going to use

the automatic extraction result

variable that i got from the data

extraction

scope

sorry it's

automatic extraction data

and the output it returns is a data set

which contain multiple tables

so we can create one

extraction data set

also we see a couple of

options over here include confidence

which will say

if it is set to true it will give you

the confidence

information for each reported value

and include ocr confidence

that will return the ocr confidence

of each value so this is the extractor

confidence and this is the confidence

level that's coming from the ocr

so we can use we'll see we'll use both

and see

what's the output that we are getting

and now we'll

now we have a data set inside this code

now what we need to do is we need to

extract that data from the data set

we need to loop it because the data set

contains multiple

tables so i'm going to use it for each

and use that variable here extraction

data set

and change the type arguments to data

table because

what contains inside is a data table

and i will say data's extraction data

set dot

tables this will give you

the list of tables

and extraction data

now here i will for now just to see the

output

i will use the right range

so that you can see

[Music]

okay i don't have the excel activity so

i will just add it

all right so now i'll be using

write range

and i will just give the file path

data table is the extraction

data table the variable i gave over here

and the sheet name this thing can

contain multiple

sheets remember there is a loop that i

dress

through tables so i can get the name of

the

table by

using that name

table name

and the range i will say

like this and also include add headers

so we'll run this and see what's the

output that we get

so to run i have two invoices

let's see what sort of output we are

getting

so here you can see the present

validation station is still here

so don't worry about it i will

just remove it after we

do the validation right for now i just

want to show you

what's the confidence we directly get

from the data extraction scope

and based on that confidence i will show

you how to

show the validation screen

depending on that

so here we have to select the folder

path

okay so this is here for now we are just

ignoring this

oh and one has gone to the

classification station okay

so we'll do that

so

so it's in a different instance of my

orchestrator so

i'm trying to login

so

go to actions

and go to unassigned

this is what got created

and it's invoice so let's proceed

okay now i'm going to receive

so that's based on the confidence levels

we

set previously when we are talking about

the confidence

over here

so this is kind of the uh similar logic

that we are going to use but

it's a little bit different because here

we are dealing with multiple

fields so for everything for now we get

this

but yeah but now we should see

the output so

you saw that i ran this for two

documents

and it was writing in the same output

data

uh excel file but

yeah for now it's fine because i just

want to show you

the extraction

so see here this is the invoice of the

last executed

uh file and for this

value the invoice number we see the

confidence

of the extractor and we see the

confidence of the

ocr so

one means it's really good zero means

it's

bad so 0.9 means it's a

pretty good value and you can see that

it's available for each and every field

uh yeah and for this thing it's

this one so here this this contains all

those

main fields and if you

want to see any formatted values you can

use this

you can see that there are slashers and

double quotations nicely formatted

based on certain

key fields and if you go to line items

there you can see the line items of the

invoice

and for each line item you can see the

confidence

of both

and for that also you have the formatted

one so what we can do is we can use

this output to

uh actually get the

confidence and see how we can write a

logic behind that

so for that

we need to loop this again

so having said that

we'll try to change this for each

so using this two confidence levels

we can try to extract and the confidence

and figure out what's going to be

the uh how we can decide whether

we need to present the validation

station

or not so the first thing to do is

first we need to have a simple variable

saying whether we need manual

intervention or not

so i would say

let me say manual verification

this is of type

i reset it to boolean

and at the beginning i will set it to

false

and then so in this workflow you know

that

ah there are different document types

that we process

so if you actually see these extraction

scope

here you can see invoices different

types of forms

purchase orders and many more things

so depending on the document type

there might be different ways of

exporting

or validating the data

so how do we identify the document type

is by extracting

the document type from the taxonomy so

if we

actually go to taxonomy manager and open

each type here you can get the document

type

id which says finance incoming

voices and for this one it says

form 10k and so on so you might have

different

groups you might have different

categories in each group

and in each one there might be different

types

so depending on that you might need to

write your own logic

so for this purpose we have only one

group and one category

but different types so i will take this

string

and i will try to extract the last part

of that string by splitting it from this

dot so what you can do is

the next thing is you are going to use

another assign

which will

give us the document category

over here and i'm going to write the

expression

so this has to be taken from the

classification

so if you actually scroll up

if you scroll up here you can see we are

inside a loop

that we process each classification

that we return from the document so we

are going to use

this h-plus equation

to get that so getting here

so i will use h present equation

and in that i'm going to use the

document type id

and this i'm going to split because that

will return as the full stream

and i'm going to split it based on the

dot and i need to get the length

and the last character or the last

segment

of that split error

so inside the variable two

brackets i'm going to say each

classifier

document type id and split it

by the dot and get the length

of that and it will say minus 1

because length will give the full length

and i need to get the last character

now last segment which is length minus 1

so this will give us the

last type of the document

and it is going to be assigned a

document category

and now

depending on the category we are going

to

write our own logic so i'll be using

a flowchart

over here and i'm using a flow switch

why i am using a procedure is because i

have multiple document types

and that will have more than one

condition

or one path to go and say

string because i'm getting a string from

the document category

[Music]

and here is the document category

and from this i will assign multiple

parts out

so i'm going not going to do this for

all the document tiles i will do it for

one

so that you can get a clear idea how it

has to be done

so in here i'm going to say invoices

and i'm going to add one part

and this part is going to change

as invoices so for this i need to use

the same name

as we get over here because this is the

output that we get

from the document category

and for invoices

the thing i need to do is i need to

now here you can see

we have values and we have multiple data

tables

and in each we have the confidence level

as columns and you get it

in different rows as well so depending

on your logic

you can write your logic

but uh for the demo purpose i will show

you how to access

the confidence level of each and every

row and column

to do the validation because

for this validation the first step is

using the confidence because that's

where we

get to know whether the value got

extracted properly or not

so i'm getting back to invoices

so first thing is

here

[Music]

if you get here

now we know that this giving us multiple

data tables so the first thing is

to get the data tables out of that

so i'm going to use a for each

so just like we did for that excel

check this the same thing

extracted data set dot

tables and the type of that is going to

be

data table

select dd

and for each data table

i'm going to check the columns

because i need to identify the column

that

has the confidence

and i'm going to use extract dt dot

hollow for that

let me change this and in columns i need

to get

the columns type

so if you don't have it here you can go

to browse and use

data column

which you can find under system.data

and now we have access to the column

now we need to check which column we

need to

add access so we are right now not

interested in the columns that has the

value

we are only interested in the columns

that has the confidence level

so we'll write a if condition

to grab or check whether the column name

contains the confidence word

so we have two columns like that we'll

do it

for both

so i'm going to write a if

so how i will do it is we'll use the

data column

the column name pretends

uh here i will copy and paste the value

what i get over here

so why i took only that part is

prior to that we have the column name

and that changes

for each and every column so this part

is unique

so that's why i took it and i will do

that

for ocr confidence as well

and oh

color name intense

so if it is only these two either of

these two columns i will go inside

and inside that now we know the column

and now we need to loop through the rows

to get

the confidence value

so for that i'm going to use

for each row because it's a data table

and i'm going to use this extract dt

yeah and for extract dt

now we know now basically if we

come out of this

here we know what's the type of the

document

and we have uh have a

different condition for that and for

each type

we are going to look through the tables

get the column access the continuous

columns and

get the rows

so here you can also write

give a simple

flowchart

to write your logic

okay so inside this

we can write our logic depending on

the confidence level so the first step

here outside this in the data validation

the first step is to check whether this

flag we created

is still set to false because if this is

set to true

we know that it's set to automatic

verification sorry a manual verification

and we don't need to go through this

logic again

so by default is set to false

and because of that

so we need to have that column

or that check so i'm going to use the

flow decision

to check the first condition

uh

to check whether manual verification

is true or not so it's a boolean so i'm

not going to say

whether it's equal to true or not by

default it will decide

whether it's true or not so if manual

verification

is true which means

you need to verify it uh

manually and

we already know that if it is set to

true it has to be verified

manually so i am checking for the false

part of it

if it's not set to true that means we

need to go through the

conditions and check whether we need the

manual verification

for the next condition and i'm going to

assign this to the first part

because of that reason

uh

and if this

is false i will check

the next thing whether

the extracted value or the extracted

confidence

whether this value is blank

or not so if let's imagine this

field wasn't extracted

and in that case we need to

if it is not extracted say for example

the when the address did not get

extracted

through the motor in that case you will

have the values like this

so we will have any value for the

confidence

so because of that we need to first

check it

so how you can do it is

in the second condition i'm going to say

string dot is null empty

and in here i'm going to write

that condition in the row

i'm going to access the column

so we already know the dt column

the column name this will give us in

which column we

are in either of these two

and uh to string

so this will basically

give us whether is null or

empty so if it is not empty that means

it's not extracted

so i will say this is the null check

and if this condition is true if it is

not

then in my case

i'm going to say if one variable one

value is not

extracted either one value is not

extracted

i need to do a manual check

and because of that i will

set an assign here

and i will say manual verification is

true

that is only if a field has not got

extracted

and on the other hand if there is a

value extractor

which means you have the confidence

level if the confidence level is there

i need to check whether it has a higher

confidence

value something about let's say

zero point so let's see what we have

here

let's say something about 0.7 so we have

0.6

so we will get to work with the

thing the manual verification as well

so the next condition if there is a

value

that and then i need to check the

confidence level

so here you can see if we open the

excel file again

we have two

confidence columns and each give a

unique

result and over here

for one it gives the extractor

confidence at 0.9 and ocr is saying it's

-1 and likewise you have different

values that you get for each so you need

to check these two if you are using both

separately because one might

uh highly differ from the other as you

see over here

so you need to check that separately

so we'll do that now and

going back here i'm going to use

the uh flow decision

again and

the first thing is extractor

computers i will check this one so this

all depends on your logic so for now i

will show it

and to check the confidence i need to

convert this to a

numeric format so i'll be using double

for that

and i will say row

name

yeah so before that i need to check the

confidence

uh the column so first condition is

dt column name

contains because we are accessing both

columns over here

contains the first condition

is first i will check this

if it's this column

then it's going to be a separate check

if that's the case then i will use

another

decision

confidence running check

so if it's the extractor confidence then

i'm going to use i need to convert it to

a

numeric format as i explained earlier so

i will use double dot pass

of that particular row

of the column

and i will convert it to a string

and this is converted to a double

and if that conversion is less than 0.7

then i will say i will need manual

verification

and if that is true

i will say i need one more verification

and if it is not the extractor

confidence that we are

checking then

uh then again i need to set the

confidence value

so i will just copy and paste it

so this is for um

ocr let me just change the

outputs of this

to make it clear this is ocr

and if the ocr confidence i will say

this has to be something less than

0.5 for example

and if it is 0.5

and then i will say the

manual verification i need it as true

like this okay so we have multiple

conditions defined

so we need to do one more small change

in this if condition we have only these

two columns

so if

we have that flag the manual

verifications

by default it is set to false but if it

is set to true

by any chance we still don't need to

go through this logic and look for it

unless you really want to

check how many columns are blank or how

many columns are

less than the confidence level if you

have additional logic like that

so from my purpose i don't need to do

that so i will change this condition a

little bit

with by adding this

o part inside another block

and i will say it is

the manual verification has to be false

and also

you can see here in this

line items the ocr confidence is kind of

giving up

minus one figure whereas the extractor

computers is giving a very good figure

but if you actually take a look at line

items

both are giving a pretty good uh

figure so i will just

exclude this particular column from the

verification

for the time being so i will just

copy the header

and we'll add another condition if

dt

column column name

contains this

then i need to explode

it shouldn't be that far

right so we have our logic built now and

using this logic we will return

whether i need manual verification or

not

so what i need to do is using that

i'm going back to my

original location over here

and after this flowchart i will add a

simple if condition

to check whether

what's the output of this manual

verification

so if the manual verification is true i

am going to present the validation

station

if it is now for our testing purpose

let's put a message box

saying and we want to

verify something like that

so let's test our logic to see how this

really work

so i'm running it

and we get the folder path

i have two invoices

so for your case if you have multiple

document types

you just need to have its own

verification logic linked to this

flow switch i do process multiple times

but

for the time being i'm showing only for

one

so you can try out yourselves for the

rest of the

document types so this we are getting it

obviously because we don't have values

accepted for these two

for some reason

and the one went to the classification

station

the induction center will

quickly check it out

and i'm going to run this

and resume so let's see

how our logic work now

i'm hoping to get a message box so that

you can see it

really well let's see

[Music]

it's going inside

okay so we got the validation extension

again

uh for some reason let's have a closer

look

why it's saying so by the look of it you

see that it has a higher confidence

level from the extractor

here it says 99 but

maybe the ocr confidence

is somewhat low in one of this uh

let's see one four three four five

uh three double seven five it looks fine

this is looking good

and in this one

yeah the values are seems

seems to be fine this looks good

uh let's have a closer look here

maybe we need to

do a quick check

on these values so i will try to copy it

and we'll just try to compare that with

what we see over here in the first line

hpi battery 4c

this part looks fine and i la 98241

seven two four two

one okay see see here see

some of these are not extracted properly

and i don't know from where this part is

coming from

um it might be from this origin and cn

so since the extractor confidence is

high

but from the ocr however it

must be a little bit low so

let's actually see that whether if

that's

the problem so i'll just close this for

now

uh

and getting back to this logic we'll try

to add a message box

over here and

we will try to add this code

so what i'm trying to do here is i'm

going to

show you in a much more clear way

so for the extractor confidence i will

say extract just an

the column and the confidence level

and i will do this same thing

for this ocr confidence as well so i

paste it over here

to see why it's actually what is causing

it to

get into true state so here i will say

it's instead of extractor we say ocr

we will see what's causing it

this should be interesting um

okay so i'm going to run it again

so i have the for the bots

examples

okay so for the first document

here it says the extractor and the

invoice has

gone into zero point the confidence

level of

the extractor has for invoice number

as 0.5 which is less than 0.7 which we

placed over here so that's fine

and that also has some null values

as we saw earlier in our previous run

for this window address and this stuff

and also you can see here the invoice

number confidence is

less than what we define so let's

save it for now and the other one goes

to

the classification

because we had the classification

check over there and you can see it's 62

percent

so i'll just save it

and resume the process and let's see

what is actually causing that state to

get to true while we see a higher

percentage

from the extractor for all the fields

so it's executing

and we didn't have any field as blank

either so it has to be

from okay so

have a look at this and it's coming from

the ocr

and it says from ocr confidence

in the description column the ocr

confidence is

0.0999

so that is very less okay

so the description column is in the line

items

and if you have a look

as early as the extractor confidence is

very high

so basically the extractor extracted all

the lines

but this is the image as you see a

scanned image

but in terms of the ocr side

there is a problem and here you can see

it is not the exact same thing that got

extracted

there is a slight difference

for the second line here you can see

after

cd

cd it says factor space

y e a e something

so it's like it though it's highlighting

all these things

um some of those have not got extracted

or identified properly through the ocr

so this is the benefit of

so the output is not expect

what we got is not expected because i

was expecting

to see

this particular message box from here

which can be automatically verified but

it's fine but

good thing is we found a nice scenario

to explain how the two

confidence levels help us to validate

the data accuracy

so from the extractor point of view we

got everything extracted

without a problem but from the ocr

confidence it says that though you

extracted everything here i have a small

issue with these two

lines so check it out so

that's the benefit of having both ocr

confidence

to check your data

so that's fine so good thing is we have

the validation station

to proceed without

entering any wrong information to a

system so we can

update it here and then continue

right so that's the benefit of using

both

in your validation logic

so the one last part is using

the action center to perform this

validation station or the validation

so just like you did for classification

over here

we did create action and

weight insider try catch is the same

thing that we need to do

for the validation as well

so i will just put this outside just for

the time

being just to show you how to do that

so i'm going to use a create

uh this time i'm using create document

validation action

on this side so for the title i will say

document meditation

uh

yeah instead of using the file name

so i can copy it from here

the path yeah so i will just copy this

part

which shows us the document

name in the validation station

just like we did for classification the

priority can be anything

medium high or critical action catalog

[Music]

which can be uh

you can have it as null for the time

being

action folder path i will just copy it

from over here

yeah we don't need the folder

yeah sorry now for the action catalog we

can say

data validation

we don't need the folder card for the

time date

the bucket name i will copy it from

this the duck tart

and the bucket gravy part again is the

folder path so since i have it

configured in the specification i will

use the same

and here we can give the folder

path it's the

item from the document the document text

document object model

the taxonomy

and why it is

uh yeah sorry it's

dog taxonomy

and automatically extraction result is

coming from this variable

automatic extraction data

and here we have to specify the action

object using this only it will

look for the weight activity input

variation action object

and now i have to use a try patch

to perform the

date activity because it can

return exceptions the user marks the

document as

exception that's why we are using a file

catch just like

in classification

and in the weight i'm using weight for

document validation

action and for the action

object i'm using the same variable we

see here

validation action object

directory path it can be my downloads

folder

and we don't need the action object for

now

so here the validated extraction result

is our validated result

that's returned from the action center

so i'm going to create a new

variable for that validated

extraction data

and i will change the scope of that

variable

to be same as the extraction result

okay so we already have it have that

variable so i will just

uh remove this the one we created

so if you don't have that variable

please create it

in the same scope as automatic

extraction data

so and the document path is

is so these are the outputs that we get

from the uh validation action

document object model it's just

assigning it to the same variables

and the automatic one is automatic

extraction data

so this is going to be our output

and in the try if

the user requests as exception

i will

have an exception created over here

so similarly we that we did that same

thing for

classification exception

so likewise i will do it for the

extraction as well so all you need to do

is i'm going to assign

so if you don't remember what happened

in the classification

if you check this exception part

we assign it to assign the exception to

classification exception

so likewise and that variable was

declared

at the very beginning

as you see over here classification

exception and we have the validation

exception

which we created in the very first set

of videos

and this variable is what's going to be

assigned

if the user reposits as an error

so let's do that over here now

in the this is our create

and in the exception i will use the

assign

and validation exception

is going to be our exception

okay so we have

configured the validation logic

and now we don't actually need the

present validation station

but we have to do something additional

so instead of this message box now

i'm going to remove it and put a assign

activity there

why i do that is so here

from this create and wait we are

the result is x assigned to a validated

extraction data variable so i have to do

it

for automatic verification as well

so i am going to use the validated

extraction data here

and assign the automatic extraction data

to that

so by doing this now you have

the output assigned

to the validated extraction result

so the last part remains is

how you are going to

use this validated extraction data

to extract the output and

uh maybe to write into different excel

files

or to use it in other downstream

applications

so we'll have a look at that in the next

video

which we will focus on how to extract

the data

and based on that extracted data

how we can train our classifications

and how we can train our extractors

so we are coming towards the end of this

particular video

and this series will end in the

next video that's uh that will be

released

in a couple of days so hope you learned

the how to perform the validation

and it is it was a little bit complex i

know

but it is very important to know this

part

because it is the one of the key points

when it comes to document understanding

how you can

validate and how you can assign a task

to a user whenever you feel

that someone has to intervene and verify

the data

so thank you very much for listening and

talking i'll see you in the next video

take care
