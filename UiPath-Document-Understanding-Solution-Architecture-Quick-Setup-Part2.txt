hello welcome back to my channel so this

is the second part of the series of UFO

document understanding solution

architecture

and in the first one we looked at the

overall architecture of the solution

how it should be

so in this one we will look at how we

can achieve this using the uipath

document understanding framework

so basically

we are not going to cover everything

about the framework in this video but we

will see what are the different

execution methods we have in the

framework

like the attended and unattended

and then we'll look at the major

difference between those two

and finally we will look at how we can

quickly set up a new document

understanding framework

to quickly run

for invoices or research so that's

the framework is

already built to

handling invoices than receipts so with

quick steps we can easily get it up and

run

so we'll see how we can do that

so in the framework this is uh how it

looks like

so over here you can see

um two different options one is for

unattended the other one is for

attendance

um if you look at the flow

by high level you can see that it's

almost the same

the structure looks very much the same

but there is a small difference

so when it comes to unattended it is

designed to run

um without any

intervention the only place where

we can involve is for the validation so

for that it will use the action center

so the validation will happen for

classification it will also happen for

document data extraction

and all these things will go into action

center as a task and you can verify it

from there this is

we'll get into this stuff later

but when it comes to attended it is

slightly different

so one more thing so for ordinary tender

you can see it is using the queue as the

source

to process the documents but there is

also an extra option

you can also pass in the file as an

argument and set this to false

so this refers to the structure that we

spoke about in the first part

the a human can involve and process only

this document processing flow

so it is designed to do that and when it

comes to attended it is slightly

different you can see if in attended

mode you also need to find a way to pass

the file path

so that will happen

through a simple select document window

so through that you can pass in the file

and then the validation and

classification sorry the classification

and data extraction validation will

happen through the validation station

this it is the it will use the present

classification station

and it will use the present uh data

validation station so it's the intended

version of the action center task

so that's the major difference that you

see

and even in this you can see the two

input arguments

the same as in the unattended so this

way

when you publish this process into

orchestrator you can either use that job

running screen or you can connect this

with any other

application like about apps to pass in

the

file path and process it

so this is the major difference in these

two

but the overall architecture looks

exactly the same

and as I mentioned before the framework

is originally designed to process

invoices and receives

um so with that we can quickly set it up

and

make it work for the either of these two

document types

but if you want to add any other extra

document type

you need to configure

but that's the topic for another another

video

so for this one we'll just see how we

can easily configure this and what are

the steps required

to do a quick setup and get it up and

running

so the major

changes or the major things that you

need to look at is not in the workflow

it's actually in the config file so you

can find the config file under the data

folder

give me a second to open this

so in the config file

we have a lot of

settings here

so you get a lot of settings in the

settings sheet

and the constants

assets

the noise processing analysis

so in this video we will not look at all

of these things we'll only look at the

things needed to get it up and running

real quick for invoices and it applies

for receipts as well

so in the setting sheet this highlighted

uh

options are the things that you need to

look at

so if we quickly go through the folders

of the configurations the first one is

to show or to have a folder where all

the validated items that gets downloaded

so all the documents that go into action

center when it is resumed it downloads

to a temporary folder

so that's this one

and this is where you are going to store

all the exported data as in Excel files

once the validation is done

so you can keep it as the default path

so you can change it to any other

location

and if you are using training to retrain

your models

this is where you are going to store the

training data that you need to pass to

the action center

so this applies for receives and this

applies for invoice

and this is where you are going to have

your uh intelligent keyword classifier

or the keyword classifier Json file

and these are your endpoints so as of

now I'm not going to do any changes here

I'll be using these endpoints as it is

but let's assume in your process you

have a invoice model that you have

trained in your AI Center and you have

it as a public skill

so those things you can change this

endpoint and easily connect it

so that's all you need to do here

in your assets sheet

you have a set of assets so basically

you have

12 assets that you need to configure

and first one is for the API key and

this is to

see or set whether you want to always

run the validation uh

manual validation

you can also read through the thing

and this is to mention whether you want

to always do the manual data extraction

verification

whether you want to skip classifier and

extract the training so all these are

like Boolean values

and then you have the action catalog

that you need to create in action center

and it's fold apart

storage bucket folder path the name and

the folder path

and where you have the document

understanding queue to get the documents

from and the classification threshold

and then you just need to mention the

orchestrator folder path where all your

assets are going to get created

so let's get to the orchestra

so in my orchestrator I have created all

these Assets in this folder the demo

slash document understand

so if you go here all these are my

assets

so as of now this is my configuration so

I'm saying I don't want to

do the classification all the time I

need to validate and only do it when

needed same for validation the data

extraction part

and this is my catalog name I'll also

show you how to create the catalog

action folder path

where the catalog is this is

classification threshold queue name

where the queue is

and storage bucket path and storage

bucket name

so if I go to storage box under this

folder

you can see my storage box this is the

orchestrator

provided one

so how to create the action catalog

for that you need to go into actions

so in actions

um you need to go to the admin View

from this admin settings

and you can see the same folder

structure as you see in your

orchestrator

go into the folder that you need to

create the action catalog

and you can create it from here

just give a name and just click on

create

I already have mine created

so that's the name that you see in my

queues I'm sorry the assets

here you go

so once you have done that configuration

and once you have created these assets

in your config file just update where

all these are located in your folder

structure in Orchestra

and that's it so once you have done this

configuration

you have solution is ready to run

so if you go to

um

our workflow over here

whether it's attended or whether it's

unattended

we need to find a source to run the

documents

so as I mentioned to you the other day

in our structure

um

if we are going with unattended we need

to have a source solution that focus on

your data source and collects the

documents and put it into a queue

and then the document understanding flow

will run as one job per document

and it will process those

so for attended you can give the folder

path for unattended you need to have a

solution

so it will quickly run the attended

version

so I can show you how it works

so I have configured everything now

I'll close my config file

and then I'll

track so in our while this thing runs in

our

upcoming videos will also look into each

and every workflow that's available here

this is just the starting point

um so it should give me a pop-up window

foreign

let me go to my folder structure

have two invoices here let's try running

with this

so you can see it's the initialization

started

it will take few seconds so

digitization started

and here we have the classification

so you can see it already identified it

as an invoice

and now the data extraction will take

place

and I should see the validation station

and here we have it

so it's used in the public endpoint of

the invoices I don't have a invoice

model created right now but if you have

it you can update your config file with

that end point

so you can see it already it was already

able to extract information so I'll just

click on continue and

okay

and the files get saved by default in

this export folder because I did not

change the file path and here you can

see this is the new file

if we open the file

we can see all the extracted information

and this is the formula sheet with the

formatting and here you have the line

items

so that's how it works

so you basically saw the attended

version of the process

so what if we want to run this as

unattended

so I'll show this in the orchestrator is

so that I can show you the two different

variations

so all you need to do is just publish

this into your orchestrator

and once you have it

so I have already done it for my

scenario over here

so once you have it in your orchestrator

just go to jobs

and start so this is how you usually run

the unattended part if it is scheduled

it will create a job

so just select the process

and in this argument section you can see

the two input arguments that we have in

our workflow over here

these are the two input arguments but

for us to run this

we need to have items in the queue

but for this one we don't need because

this is

bypass in the queue and it will just

take the value from here

so let me confirm

so if you go into the queues

I already have a queue over here and I

don't see any transactions inside

um so for us to run this

let me go to jobs I'll start a new job

and under these two options will give a

folder uh name so that we can try

I'll copy the path from here I'll update

this value

we don't need double quotes

save it

change this to false because you're not

going to use the queue

so what happens here is we are changing

these two only for this job the change

we do here does not affect your process

the default settings

so this will only happen for the job and

just click on start

and now you can see the process is

running

Let me refresh

here you can see the process running

let's give it few seconds

so you can see it is creating the

validation action now

and it went into suspended mode

so let's get to the evaluation station

we have one unassigned activity

this created just few seconds ago let me

assign to myself

and this is our invoice so it was able

to identify but I mentioned the

threshold as 70 in the asset and that's

why we are getting this

so let's finish the action

and this should start

so you get the idea now

um so through that

option through that arguments option we

see in the jobs you can run any process

at any given time from uh

from the user

on the other side if you want to run

this in a queue as the usual unattended

fashion

so I will not do the verification for

the validation because

is the usual procedure

so if you want to run this in a queue

um you need to have a different solution

that updates the key

so for that I have a separate uh Studio

solution you can see here

that monitors my invoices folder and all

it does is it updates the items into a

queue

so let's run this and let's quickly

update the queue

so you can see on your left side output

funnel it's updating the items to the

key so we have like 10 documents

and if we go to our queue now

we should see

10 new items earlier we had only one

successful one

that was processed like yesterday

so now for this queue if we run our

process over here

it will learning process one item

so let's start

so this time I'm not going to change

anything over here it's

the default setting

and for this one we'll do the full uh

full cycle so that we can see how it

works

so we have the actions suspended we'll

quickly go here

and we'll take the latest one

so that was the validation action that

you saw earlier that we created

so I'll finish this

and here's the logs

and it's creating the validation action

now

so if you come here

this is the latest validation in action

oh sorry

yes this is the old one that we

processed manually this is our latest

one

and I'll not go through the full

validation

so let's just submit

all I wanted to show here is how this

flow works

and what happens when one iteration ends

so the data export is happening and the

process enter

the reason is it process only one

document in a job

so how are you going to configure that

so that it takes all the items in a

queue without us triggering the job

that is happening actually through a

a trigger

so if you go to automations and the

triggers you can actually create a q

trigger

to look at that queue so this is a Time

list one if you go to few triggers

you can say I want to run this process

and I want to monitor this queue

and every time there are new items I

want to trigger this process

so once you have done that every time

the queue gets updated it will

automatically trigger the job for each

item

so that's how

your du process is going to get executed

so that way if you get 10 items into the

queue you will have 10 jobs taking care

of each item

same happens for any number of documents

you add to the queue

so this is the high level easy setup

um in the document understanding

template

and that's with those easy steps you can

just quickly configure your process run

it for invoices or visits

and in the following videos

we'll see we'll go into Asian average

workflow here and see how we can

configure those

in the step by step

okay so that's it for this video I hope

this is helpful for you to understand

how the document understanding framework

works

and how you can easily set it up in and

do the configurations in the config

sheet and action catalogs

and that's it so thank you for listening

and I'll see you in the next part of

this series thank you so much and have a

good day
