hello welcome to my new video on

train easy document classification

in this video we'll be exploring a new

feature

in document classification which we call

as

references so in this video we'll be

looking at how we can add change and

remove

these references when we are doing the

classification

while the process is running so that is

the most important part

so when we say references this is

referring to

the keywords so as we know

when you are doing the classification we

use keywords

to classify a document

and in uipath studio we have

multiple specification methods

the very basic one is the keyword based

classifier

which we provide keywords

to classify the documents

and on the other side we have the

intelligent keyword classifier

which is capable of automatically

identifying keywords

for each different type of document and

the other one is

um machine learning classifier which

is used in combination with ai center

so all three is using

keywords to identify these documents

so to explain this concept better i'm

going to use the keyword based

classifier which is the most

basic one

so earlier what we used to do is

we used to provide the keywords

in the um

in the keyword based classifier

but now with this feature instead of

providing it first we can add it while

the process is running

so before getting into that let's have a

look at

the workflow and the type of documents

we have so if

you are not familiar with the activities

we use for

document understanding framework i

highly recommend

you to go through the document

understanding courses available in

academy

and also in my youtube channel

you have a full series there

so coming back to the very top

i have um

[Music]

three different files here process i

have two invoices

of different layouts these are sample

documents which i was able to

find on through the internet

so we have two documents like this

and also along with that i have another

image

for a purchase order

so in the

workflow let me take you through that

first i have defined the taxonomy

so in the taxonomy i have created two

groups finance

and incoming is the category and inside

that i have the two

um types of documents one is the invoice

and the other one is the purchase order

as you see we have not provided any

field fills here as yet

um we are not doing data extraction in

this video

this one will be only looking at the

classification so it is not needed for

now

but in the ideal case you can have field

fields as well

so we have created two types

and in the workflow the very first one

is i am getting the data or the input

files

from the files folder which is available

inside the same solution

the three files i showed you earlier and

then i'm doing the

load taxonomy

then to look through the files i'm using

the

for each activity for this array

and for each file i do the

digitized document and

i'm using the omnifetch ocr for this

instance

the properties of these activities are

the same as the

default i have only defined the

variables here

so after digitizing i have the

classified document score

for this one i am providing the file

paths the document text

object model and the taxonomy output

is the auto classific auto classified

data which is off of classification

result type array

and in this one i'm using the

keyword-based classifier

so i have provided the file path for the

json file

so it is located in here

if i open this you are classified so you

can see this file is empty as of now

i'm using this one because it's easy to

explain

and you can visually see what's

happening

but the same concept applies to the

other two

classification methods the intelligent

keyword classifier

and the machine learning classifier

so i have provided the file path but i

haven't done

or provided any keywords yet

and in the configure classifiers i have

mentioned that i'll be using this

keyword based classifier for specifying

invoices and purchase orders

and then i have the present

classification station

and after that using the validated

classification

results i'm going to train

the classifier keyword-based classifier

so i'm pointing to the same json file

i'm pointing to the same json file but

no key was defined yet and only thing

i'm doing is

i'm saying i'll be using the

this trainer to train the invoice and

purchase orders

for keyword based classifier

so why we have this trainer is actually

to update the json file based on

the references we provide

so this is the simple workflow

and let's run this and

and then we'll look at how we are going

to use the references

i'm going to run it and it's going to

pick the files from this location

and here we see the

classification station for the first

document

so as of now i'm not going to

uh provide any keywords so the main

thing is it is saying not classified

because it is unable to figure out what

type of

document it is because we haven't

provided the keywords

so for now is instead of providing any

references i will just say

this is going to be an invoice and

then

and for this other document i will just

do the same

invoice and save

and then we get the last one for the

purchase order

and i'll do purchase order and save it

so the process completed successfully

um let me enable the logs

but if we look at the json file

even though we said that those are

invoices and purchase orders

it didn't update the json file because

we didn't provide any references

and next time if you run you will see

the same screen

it will not know what type of document

it is

but this is because we are using the

keyword classifier

but if you use the intelligent keyword

classifier

it will automatically pick the

references

based on its uh knowledge and it will

update the json file

but later you can change the keywords

or the references so let's

now see how we can

use uh the keyword based classifier

to add and remove references

so again i'm not using the intelligent

keyword classifier here because it's

difficult to actually show what's

happening

okay so we'll run the same thing again

and we are here now

so this time i'm going to select this as

invoice

and instead of giving the invoice as a

reference i will just

provide another value just to show you

something

so instead of using a common one i will

just use

this uipath sra

so the good thing is you can either

highlight the keywords here

just like what you see here or else

you can switch to

text mode and from there

you can go to the selection mode

and go for tokens

and then select the keywords that you

need to

include for this one we'll do it in the

textbook

so i'm going to select uipath and

srl so i have two words selected here

and how i'm going to add this as a

references

while this is selected i'm going to

click on these three

dots and say add reference

and then you can see a small icon

popping up here

which also has options to highlight

reference and remove reference

we'll have a look at that in a bit

so now for this document we have given

the two

references and we have selected the type

and now i'm going to save save this

and then here it comes to the next one

so in this one this document does not

have the ui path srl

anywhere that's why it doesn't know that

this is also

a document of the same type

so before showing this let me quickly

open the

keyword classifier so now you can see a

value

which is uipath sro the reference i

selected

so this is how you can add references

to the keyword based classifier or the

intelligent keyword pacifier

it's the same concept

so let's close this and try the same

thing for this one

so in this one instead of selecting

invoice

i'll select the date

which means this date

so i'm going to select click on this

and and say add reference

and select this as the inverse

as the concept

so let's see what happens now

so the keyword classifier will update

the file

as you see now you have two values this

is the first one

and this is the second one

and it also says how many times this

this keyword was confirmed

as of now it's only one

and this is the next document which is a

purchase order

but see this is the trick now you can

see that this purchase order has got

selected as an

invoice and showing us 44 percent

confident

but how did this become an invoice

what are the references

that made it become

invoice instead of a purchase order

that we can see by clicking on this

small icon

on top of this page and click highlight

reference so you can see a small

red color line

highlighting the word date so in the

previous document i specified

date as a reference for invoice

but here we have the same

date in this document so that

it is thinking that this is a

invoice so now how to change this

instead of just selecting this as a

purchase order

we'll also try to change this reference

so what i'm going to do is

i'm going to select this purchase order

and click on these three dots

and say you can either remove reference

or you can change the reference so for

now i'll just

do change so if you remove

you need to add it again so let's

let me show you one thing as so i'm

going to click on remove

this remove will actually remove the

reference so that this icon will also

disappear

and if you want to get that back to the

previous state

like undoing you can click on discard

changes

yeah so we'll need to confirm and i'm

going to say this card

and now you have this icon again

and i can click on highlight reference

so again it's showing the date

okay so instead of dead i'm going to say

use this purchase order so i'll select

change reference

and now it's changed to purchase order

and i'm also going to say this is

not an invoice it is a purchase order

and click on save

okay now let's have a look at the file

again

so now we have the date the previous one

you have for the server and the purchase

order

the third keyword

so that's the file now we'll have a look

at

the activity itself here

keyword based classifier if i go to

manage learning

here you can see it has automatically

updated itself

so instead of typing now we can use this

feature to train the model and you can

see

as you saw earlier it will also improve

your classification so

you don't need to specifically train now

if

the document is tagged as a different

different type at the same time

while the process is running you can

manually add the reference

and then update it so that next time it

will use the new

keywords so this is

how it was done the same thing applies

in the other classifiers as well but

in those you will have a lot of more

data in the json file

so it will be very hard to track there

but still it works

okay so let's run this again to see

how it is work how it is classifying the

documents

and this is our first file and it says

this is an invoice which is correct

but let's highlight the reference you

can see

this is highlighted so i don't want to

use this

because this is not a proper keyword to

identify invoices

invoice word is much better

so i will say

just remove this reference and i want to

use

this as the new reference

and i'm going to add it

and say save

so in the next document let's see

what happens so here it is identified as

the invoice

and let's see what's the keyword

now you can see it didn't identify the

date

as the keyword it

is highlighting invoice because i

updated

in the previous login so it all applies

and it all works together

this is correct and let's play concept

and the purchase order now it is

classifying it

properly because i added the purchase

order reference

if i say highlight here you go

that's how it works so let me click on

save

so this is the concept of changing

adding and removing references it

basically helps you to

improve the accuracy of the

classification

in the documents use the same concept

irrespective of whether you are using

the keyword based classifier

or the intelligent keyword classifier or

the machine learning classifier

it all works together to improve

the accuracy of the classification

process

so i hope this

video was helpful to understand how we

can improve

the classification process using the

references

try it out yourself and let's see

how it improves your accuracy of the

process

thank you very much for listening and

i'll see you back again

in another video until then take care
