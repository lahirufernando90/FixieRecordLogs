foreign

since I last did a recording

um so there has been a lot of things

happening in the background and that's

why I couldn't actually do a proper

recording

so basically in today's recording we'll

be talking about

document understanding

it's mainly about the questions that we

have been getting on

um in creating document understanding

projects

so we thought of addressing all of these

questions in a video so by taking one by

one so in each video we'll be doing a

answering a specific question and

likewise we'll be doing a series on this

so

this is the first video so let's look at

what our first question is

and in today's one we'll be looking at

how to select a OCR engine

for document understanding projects

because we have a lot of OCR engines so

what is the best suitable OCR engine for

our specific project

what's the way to do that

so this one is called OCR benchmarking

so let's have a look at it

so for different projects we will be

having different document structures so

depending on your scenario we might come

across structured documents we might

come across semi-structured documents or

even unstructured documents

and what we need to look at is before

selecting the OCR engine we need to look

at these documents and try to understand

what are the different variations we

have

so this applies to all the three types

structured semi-structured and

unstructured so we need to take these

separately let's say for example we have

a combination of structured and

semi-structured documents

so you need to take a look at first the

structured documents and see what are

the variations we have in these

structured documents like for example we

could be having computer generated

documents and it could be standards and

sometimes it could be even images

so identify this different categories or

different types as you see in the first

part of the diagram

and then in each

identify how those things are how what

are the variations that you see in those

specific things

like for example if it's a scanned form

we can have handwritten data or we could

have computer generated data

because sometimes some applications

allow us to

type without really typing on top of a

scanned document

so what are those variations and we just

need to identify those things

and then the third level

once you have that information then look

at how the pages are oriented whether

it's inverted or whether it's not

inverted and if they see the proper

layout

and just see what all these variations

you can find because when it comes to

documents there can be many different

ways of representing the data and many

different ways of

presenting that data to us just like

what we see on the screen

so for each type

identify what are the different

variations how the data is presented and

how the page is presented to us

and once you have that information go

down to the most granular level just

like what you see on the screen in the

below diagram

and capture that as your final set of

variations that you see for both

for all the types structural

semi-structured unstructured and

whatever the tiles you see in each of

those

so once you have that

then is the time to apply the OCR

engines on top of this

this also gives you an idea what kind of

OCR engines you need to use like for

example

like looking at this you you know that

we have handwritten text and we need to

have our CR engine that's supposed

so likewise you can select

the OCR engines that support this kind

of scenarios and then we need to apply

the documents and run them through these

OCR engines

to see what gives the best accurate Visa

so this is what we call the OCR

benchmarking

so why do we do this there are a couple

of benefits first one by doing this

segregation or by doing this analyst

since you identify the different

variations of data so that's the first

point

the second benefit is by doing this

analysis you identify what are the best

OCR engines that support

the best extraction and the best

accuracy that you can find

so you might come across a question why

can't I use the OCR engine I used in my

previous project

that depends

the OCR engine that gave you the best

result in the previous project might not

be the best option for this one

so that's why we need to perform this

benchmarking analysis

so how to perform the Benchmark that's

our next question

so once you have all these things you

create another structure just like what

I'm going to show you now

so this is something that I created for

our

recording purpose

so in my case I have identified three

OCR engines and we have semi-structured

documents

so that's the categorization you see

here so the same category that I showed

you earlier is shown here in the excerpt

and then once we have this category and

once we have identified the different

LCR engines

then it's time to apply this OCR engine

on the different variations you have

identified before

and on top of that

we are not just

identifying the accuracy of those CRS in

just different variations we are also

looking at specific fields that we would

like to extract

so if it's an invoice that we are trying

to process

we will need to focus on specific Fields

like individual Fields like inverse

number invoice date address and so on

and also we will come across nine level

information that are presenter in a

table

like the item code description quantity

unit price and things like that

so

have those things in in your Excel and

mention whether it's a regular field or

a table it feels just for easy reference

once you have that

and once you have this all the

variations identified get a good number

of documents to run it through these

social engines

so let's say for example we have 10

documents from each variation that we

know so for example if it's an invoice

let's get 10 documents from computer

generated type and let's get

10 documents from scanned but

handwritten information and likewise so

having the same number of documentation

documents for each type will help you

get a proper active result

so it doesn't need to be 10 all the time

but have a good number of documents so

you can do a profile analysis

so once you have that

create a small flow and run these

documents through these variations or

through this OCR engines

and check the accuracy level of the data

that is extracted and note it down

in an extra sheet like this

so what you see over here is for one

specific document from each type

so likewise what you can do is if you

have 10 documents for each variation

note it down

for all the 10 documents and see for

which documents the OCR engine gives the

best accuracy and which OCR gives the

best accuracy for which variation

so for example

here if you look at this

this description

so you can see

this is an example when it comes to

description handwritten inverted gives

us the lowest

confidence level for this OCR engine but

on the other side

this OCR engine can give us

a better result

so this is just an example this is not

showcasing the capabilities of different

rows here this is just applying and

showing you how the how we can do this

analysis

and with that you can see

if you get an average of these OCR

engines you can actually see which OCR

engine gives you the best result for the

different variations

and in addition

the next another Advantage you get here

is you can decide which OCR engines to

use

and

if there are scenarios like this there

are certain Fields have a less accuracy

or less confidence on that OCR that you

select

how can I achieve a better accuracy for

those specific Fields you can actually

use that secondary OCR that you

identified through this analysis in your

workflow

so that you can write your own

validation logic by combining the output

of these two or three OCR engines that

you are using

and get the best best possible accuracy

and the reliability of data

so this is how you do the OCR

benchmarking and those are the benefits

of doing this so just remember always

follow this pattern to easily identify

the different variations

and

the best OCR engine for your specific

project and the documents that you plan

into process

so that brings us to the end of this

recording and if you have any other

questions or any concerns regarding the

same topic you can put all those

questions in the comment section and

we'll be taking up those things as well

in the following recordings

so thank you very much for listening and

I'll see you in another video take care
