welcome to my new video so this time

it's bit around intelligent document

processing standardization and

pre-processing tips

so

um why I thought of doing this recording

is

when it comes to document understanding

projects sometimes the document

standardizing and formatting matters a

lot so when I say formatting it's not

the format of the document that I'm

referring to

the document format can be anything it

could be a structured one it could be

semi-structured unstructured

um anything

what I'm specifically referring to is

how this document is created

because

when we work with lot of documents

and and these documents are actually

created by so many people

uh before it is submitted to the

document understanding workflow

so that creates a lot of variations

so usually in in documents we could see

handwritten text we could see computer

generated

documents but not just that we can see a

lot more

so sometimes if it's a form

we can

fill it digitally

um using a PDF editing tool or something

or else we can scan it you can write it

and then

sorry we can scan it and then edit it

on a PDF editor

or you can print it write it and scan it

so there are so many different ways

not just that you can also add digital

signages digital stamps

and sometimes

you also add different attachments

comments highlights

um

so many things

so basically when these kind of

variations happen

sometimes you might also end up with

content

where those are not supported in a

different machine or based on different

versions and sometimes this might create

uh issues in the file I have seen this

happening many times in Enterprise

projects

so some of those common things are like

some pages are hidden some documents

have corrupted content unknown font

types because those are edited

through a PDF editing tool

so there are so many variations which

can actually

break our process the document

understanding process it could be the

digitization step or it could be

classification extraction

anything can fail because of these

variations

now you might think

we can have exception handling we can

have different procedures in place

but you can do that but there is a limit

you can't have a

code change for each and every variation

that you see in documents

and just one more thing I forgot to

include here is the uh sometimes you

might you might see PDF files with lot

of pages but each page having a

different size altogether

so you can see how many variations we

can get into when it comes to documents

so I can quickly show you one example

so if you take this invoice

this is Adobe

um so through this I can add comments

or I can add stamps highlighting

so basically this tool supports many

things and I can also do signatures

but this is just one tool there are so

many PDF where it into is available and

they might have a lot more features than

this depending on the software that

people are using

So based on these things sometimes when

you add these stuff on a document

it might break the digitizing process

so how can you do a quick

standardization on these things

so one option is

either you do it through these tools

like Adobe or as you can do it in the

programming level as well

so we'll focus on the programming side

in a different video

um because that require a little bit of

workflow design

and going through some

components available to do that

but one easy step that you can do is

so if it's a document let's say for

example I am using the same noise

um but let's say you have a lot of

documents with multiple pages and there

are so many variations like that

the easiest thing that you can do is

go here into file option in print

this gives you some configuration

so basically you can

use this print option to create another

PDF file a copy of this

with the settings that you see on the

screen right now

so you can set this option shrink

oversize pages and comments and forms

set it to the document property

so there are multiple options here but

set it to documents so that all those

things get added into the document

itself and there will be no extra things

so let's say for example if someone

added comments

or someone added text to fill in blanks

in the form

when you select this option it will get

kind of

embedded into the document

so it will not be a separate element

that you can move around and edit

so use this configuration and then once

you click on print

this will create us a new PDF file

in addition to that if you also want to

go one step further and make this

document a grayscale black and white

let's say you have a lot of colors in

the background on behind text that might

interfere

in the accuracy levels in that way

in that case you can change

this document into a grayscale one which

may help improving the accuracy in

identifying text on a document

so do that and create a new PDF file and

then basically this step takes only few

seconds for anyone

do that and then submit that document

into the workflow and that will solve a

lot of issues

but

you can decide how you want to use it

because sometimes you might not even see

these kind of variations but sometimes

depending on the process you will

so analyze the process very well see

what kind of variations you can find how

people create these documents and based

on that decide how are you going to do

the standardization but it is important

when you have a lot of variations as I

told you

um better to do this because that helps

a lot in

eliminating a lot of errors

so this is one small tip for

uh standardizing before submitting the

document into document understanding

workflows

so I will see you in another video where

I will be focusing on the code level

and a few other things so this is just

one tip for now and I hope this helps

thank you so much and I'll see you soon
