hello everyone so welcome to the path

3.2 in advanced your part document

understanding

so in this session we will focus on

the second part of the data extraction

where we'll be using the

form extractor to extract some fields

uh from certain documents so this will

include

extracting uh a table

and extracting different fields that are

in different locations of the

document so to continue

i will get back to the studio from where

we left

off from our previous

discussion so

just to give you an idea about what we

discussed previously

in our previous uh sessions we did

we created a workflow

that actually creates the taxonomy

the digitization and then we talked

about classification

and then we talked about

document classification action and we

also talked about

how to invoke different processors based

on the classification

wizard to organize

the process documents and then we spoke

about

the machine learning extractor and the

use of

ai models that we have published in ai

fabric

so in today's video we will mainly focus

on the form extractor

so i'm going to use two of the documents

that we used earlier

which is the form 10k and form 4. so

again these are publicly available

details so

let me show you what we are trying to do

so this is the form 10k

in this documents

i want to extract the name of the

company

which you see over here

and in the second page i have

a concentrated ordered balance sheet

which i need to extract

so i'll be using the form extractor to

extract

this table so that i can show you how we

can

create a template to

actually extract any table based on the

document that you are going to process

and additionally i am going to show

how to add different rows in the same

table we created in the template

so we'll talk about that later and in

this document

i'm going to show you how we can extract

few data elements so i'm not going to go

with the

form extractor for this entire document

i'll be

extracting couple of fields

so i'll be extracting

the name portion over here the address

so this address is a special case

here we see the address has

to pass we'll see how to extract that

and the name and the date the rest

of this table and what we see over in

this section

uh we will talk about that in our next

video

on critics so in regex we'll

see how to extract data of a table

and special scenarios like this

so for today's discussion will focus on

this stuff

so getting back to the studio

we already have three extractors

so i'm going to use the form extractor

for this case

uh and i'll be pressing it somewhere

over here inside the data extraction

scope

so as soon as you place it over here you

can

see the endpoint so this is the endpoint

that

the form extractor will be using to

do its extraction

and as you remember i'm using the

enterprise trial version

so the document understanding

the api key will not work for this url

so in that case i need to change this to

the enterprise version

so click over here get to end point

and you got to change your url

with the edition so all you need to do

is click over here

and type this part

followed by a question mark we have to

say edition equals

enterprise and

if you actually try this url in your

browser

um this will give you a result

something like this so this basically

means that endpoint is working

and the request that you did is

successful

so use this and click on ok

the next one is the api key so as we

discussed in our previous videos

we are getting the api key from the

orchestrator asset that we have created

and this variable is of type secure

string

and we need to convert that to a string

so in our machine learning extractor

we have done that and we are going to

use the same

code over there and copy it in the api

key

so that i won't need to look into that

okay

but still you see your warning over here

what it says is there are no configure

templates

so we are right now going to configure

the template for the balance sheet that

we saw

in the form 10k so we'll do that now

so what you need to do is you need to

click on manage templates

and you will get a screen like this

you just need to click on create

template

and from here you need to select the

document type

and from where are we getting these

document types

it's from the taxonomy that we created

in the

very first video so we are going to

first create the template for form 10k

so i'll be selecting the form 10k

and i need to provide template name so

i'll just say

content okay template

and the next thing is

i need to select a template document

from the documents that we are

processing

then it says if it's better if it's a

native pdf file

just to improve the accuracy so we'll

select one

so i have the two files separately in

this

folder because in this video we'll be

only focusing on these two files

and i will select from 10k

so let me close this

just in case

since 10k and

here i have the only creatures here

which i'm using

and this stuff i will not do any change

and i will not

force apply ocr because there is a

native video

right so we will see how it works and

click on configure

it will digitize the document in the

background

and you will get a message like this

along with the

template manager so basically what it

says is

which for every page that we are

processing

we need to provide five minimum

five words where you can identify that

page

uniquely from the document and there are

few other instructions

that you can read and follow

okay so we will click on ok

so in this document as you see

we have 14 pages in the first page we

have

the name which we are looking at and in

the second page we have the balance

sheet that we need to extract

and in third page and fourth page you

have different other data

but we are only interested in page one

and two

so similarly for the same number of

pages we have

in the document on your left hand side

panel

we have several sections that

ask for matching info for each and every

page

up until page 14.

so we are not providing all the

information for all the pages

we will only provide the details for the

two pages that

we need to process so for page one

we want to get the name so we'll see

what kind of information we can extract

for page one matching info

so the unique identifier would be

obviously the content okay

and this type of details we can

extract so all you need to do is

you can press on the control button and

keep it pressing and using your mouse

you can left click

on the

words that you can identify

as you need for the page

so i highlighted more than five

and you just need to click on this plus

sign and it will extract

that values to page one matching input

and go into the page too

from this one i will not use the company

name because it will

differ from company to company i will

use this

second line

[Music]

yeah i will not use this i think this

will be enough

in thousands and i will add it

to this section

and page 3 and 4 we are not interested

in that so i will ignore

coming back to page one if you scroll

down

on the left hand side panel

there is a part where it asks for the

company name

so from where are we getting these

fields is from the taxonomy that we

created

so for company name and this company

we don't know how many words we'll have

in a company could be two it could be

for it can be more than that we are not

sure

so just we cannot select the word

just like we did for this matching input

we need to provide a region to

so that whatever the company name that

fits in

in that region so the best thing

would be get over here

and highlight a region where i can

possibly

have the company name so i will provide

this region

i would select from somewhere over here

and type this

as the possible area where we can find

the custom

uh company so

from these two if you select tokens

it will look at the words as highlighted

in the screen

but if you see like the custom area it

will look

at that area of itself to identify

the words in that area so i'll see that

custom

here and it's highlighted

and i will click on this plus sign again

to extract

that region

so for this you won't see the value

extracted as you saw from the

matching info you will see the custom

selection

and next is the balance sheet

so now we need to create a table

to extract this details

how we should do that so in my case

i need to get the 2020 and 2019

as the current year and the previous

year

because i would not know what year we

are progressing if we get a

document that was published last year

that you will be different so i need to

extract these two values as well

so what you can do is you can

get here in this balance sheet and once

you click on it

it will show you the columns that we are

expecting

so by default this will generate

us a data table once we extract the

values

because it's already a table so in this

data table the column names are already

balance sheet item current year and the

previously

so we won't be able to change

the title of this column to

2020 and 2019

so what we should do is we should figure

out a way

so that we know the current year

has a row that says 2020 and the

previous year column has a row

that says it's 2019

so how to create that table

we are not going to add row by row

well highlight a region

so we click on this

create new table

so how we should provide the region is

you just need to click on this

bl sheet and once you get this pop-up

click on these three dots and

select extract

new table so we have a couple of options

here

but we just need to extract the table

so click on that and

you will get a pointer something like

this

so i will start from the right hand side

because we need to get the

two years as well so i will include that

as well in my table and i will ignore as

of january 31st

so i will start giving the region as you

see here

and let go

so now we have highlighted the

table

and we have couple of options down here

so what's highlighted here is auto

detect

my mouse movements which means

based on how i move my mouse

within this highlighted region it will

detect

whether i'm looking for a column

or whether i'm looking for a row so as

you see here

if i move the pointer up and down

you will see a line moving along with my

cursor which is the row separator

but if i slide the mouse or

mouse horizontally

you can see that line changing that's a

horizontal line

sorry a vertical line

where we can identify the columns

[Music]

or else you can do the same thing with

these two options

we can select vertical line it will give

you a vertical line

and what you

so i will go ahead with auto detect

because that's easy

and over here i now need to provide the

columns

so the first easy separation is

this i will

click on where i need to break the

column

and again from here so we have

three columns that's unique

so we have now we can provide

we can assign each column to the field

that we

we are looking at so the first column is

second one is the current year this is

the previous year

now we need to provide the rows

so based on my mouse movement it will

identify

so all you need to do is you need to

just like you specify the columns you

need to specify from where each row is

getting separated

so i will select the first row from here

the second and like this i need to

specify each column

sorry each row so what we are basically

doing is we are building

the template for this table

this usually takes some time but

when it comes to data extraction it's

quite easy

so i'll do the same thing for the rest

of the rows

so over here we have rows that

span across multiple lines so for this

cell i will include that entire row

and do the same thing for what we see

over here

so that it will it should extract this

entire

string in one row

and

so we are at the very end and this is

my last row

okay so i can also specify whether i

need to extract the header or not

so i will mark it as a little extra

but remember

um i won't be extracting

even though you mark the extract header

that doesn't mean that you

extract 20 20 and 2019

so since you have marked the table so

we'll just

click on save and close

oh sorry so before click on save and

close you need to

select save new table

now you get the list of

rows along with the custom selection

so if you actually select

one row over here this custom selection

it highlights which field that is

looking at

and this is looking at this field and

this is this

and likewise but can we see

any row that actually extracts

2019 and 2020

no so this is the first row that we have

so even though we mark as extract header

means we will get this column

and but to get this 20 20 and 2019

we need to do something additional

because

the reason here is in a usual table

usually on the top we have the column

names and we indicate the table along

with that

so by default it identifies

the first row as the column

names so because

in our case we don't have any column

names over here

we have to indicate that in the first

row we have some

stuff that we need to extract so

what we need to do is

we need to create a row

and specify that this is the

row that we need to extract and that has

to be

above this selection

so all we need to do is

uh click on these three dots

and select insert row above

and you will get a new row saying not

extracted

so these columns or these rows we had

we extracted from the table of creation

but this along with the table creation

we also need to specify from where you

need to extract that

so we are not going to create any new

tables but

we are going to indicate in that region

of the table

from where we need to extract it

so all i need to do is uh

select this and detect the region

so basically the first one is this

particular area

in the table so i will select

that region and

click on this three dots add extracted

one

so that's our new custom selection and

do the same for current here and

previously

for current here i will indicate this

region and i'm not taking the token

i will specify the area

and extract value

and we'll do the same for previously

first extra

value okay so

what this check box over here it says

control that extracted row is true so we

have reviewed

it and i've already confirmed that

so i'll remove this

and we know that we have these values

and we'll select seven close enough

and this is our table and you can see

within that table i have marked the

custom row that we

included and this is

going to be our selection for this

document

so let's save it

and that's our template so we'll see

how this data is being extracted

through the validation station that we

have

over here so before doing the extraction

so we created the template now we need

to configure the data extraction score

saying the extractor to

extract fields from form 10k

so i need the company name and i need

this table

so i will go to form extract and

select this so that it will select all

the

fields available in content and

click on save okay

so i will remove this form

for temporary from here

because we first need to focus on form

then okay so i will

uh take this out place it somewhere over

here

so that in the samples folder we have

only four temperature

and now i will run this

and let's see how our output looks like

and it's asking for the final part so i

will provide

the

sound transformer

okay so we have the validation station

open in my other screen

so it has identified it as form 10k

based on the

things that we've provided and

as you see it has identified the company

name properly from the region we

gave and here comes the balance sheet

select that and

as you see the first row

is what we added after creating the

table

and as you can see the headers

uh saying that this is the current year

and the previous year

but based on our new row

we have extracted that current year is

2020 and the previous year is 2019

and starting from this row we have

the fields that we got extracted from

the

template of the table so we have

everything extracted

so if we scroll down you can see how our

rows that has manual or multiple

rows and those things have extracted

perfectly

in one particular row as you see here

and this is the row that have lot of

lines

so it's successful so that's how you

create

the template for a table and that's how

you

custom add your columns

or the things that you need to extract

inside

table template

and select save and close

so that the execution will successfully

end

so we process one document the next

document

is the form 4 where we need to extract

few

things so let's get back to form

extracted manage templates

and now i will put in

my form 4 inside

so that in the next round we can process

both

and i'm going to create a new template

just like audio

this time it's from 4

4 and for the document i'll be selecting

4 not changing anything over here

and just click on configure so i'm just

following the same steps

and you get the same screen with

the fields related to form four

so in this document we have only two

pages

and just like i mentioned earlier

it's asking page one matching equal and

page two

we don't see any other matching info

fields because this document has only

two pages

and in the second page we are not

interested about any of this

and in the first page we are only

focused on

the name the address issuer name

and these two decks

so let's see how we can do that

so first of all we need to provide the

matching

info so i'll select while

pressing my control button so i need to

highlight

five minimum fibers so i highlighted

this section

and clicking on class

now for reporting person name

i need to select this section so i'm not

interested

in extracting name and address of

reporting person so i only need the

name of that guy

so i will highlight only that portion

from this so again as i explained

earlier the name can have multiple

words so i need to highlight the

entire region not tokens

so custom area and

i'll add it to person name

and this is the region and

coming to address so here you can see

the address part of the address is on

the

top line and this section

refers to the street and the line below

refers to the city state

and the zip code so if we highlight

this entire region

you can see that street is also getting

captured

so when we run this in the extracted

result

you will also see the street as the word

so we don't need the street and we don't

need to perform any string manipulations

to

remove the string word from the address

because the address might itself have

the word straight

so we have to extract these two sections

separately so how to do that

is so i'll select on person interest

and first i will highlight only this

section

so i will highlight the first line

and provide the custom area

and add it to person address

now you can see another simple class

mark

and when you hover your mouse over it

it says select a value from the document

to extract

an additional value

so we can highlight this

part of the address and add it as an

additional value

to this same uh

column that we are for the same field

that we need so i'm just going to

highlight that section of the address

and select custom area

and click on this plus

so now you can see there are two fields

for person address and once you select

this

it highlights the first part and once

you select

the second one it highlights the second

part

so now you might wonder whether we will

get

two addresses for this

no the extractor is intelligent enough

to get the values from these two areas

and combine it into one address so we'll

see how it looks like

when we run this

so likewise if you have any other fields

what you need to do is

just combine those and it will get the

value

for you so the issuer name is what we

see over here

and i will highlight that region

error plus

and date of earliest transaction is this

section

and so amendment date

we don't have a value there but in some

documents we might

so even though we don't have a value we

know that

it's going to be here if there is any

and because of that i will highlight

that region

and add it to amendment date

so the relationship and insecurities

that i'm not worried

for this part of the

video so that's for regex

because in the records we will see

how we can extract whether is a director

officer or something else based on where

this x is placed

and in that same request

we'll see how to use regex to extract

data from a table

so that's for the for another episode

so in this section these are the pages

that we are looking at and now

click on save save and continue

and now we have two templates so click

on

close get to therapy extractors

go to four and in here

i will specify what fields i am going to

extract

through the form instructor so i need

the

person name address issuer name

date and the amendment the rest

will look at later

and i'll click on save so we have done

the extraction

and now save it and we'll see

how our two documents looks like so we

already

looked at one but let's take a look at

it again

okay so we have this

and i have the samples

okay so this is the first validation

that we did

from the form extractor so we have

already done this

so i'll just skip that for now

and this is our

new document the form 4

so as you see it has identified it as

from 4

and in the reporting person name you can

see it has

extracted the name the name

perfectly and let's

take a look at our special case the

address

as you see this is the address

and once you click on this expand thing

it will separate the address into

address line

one two three city

state country and zip code

so we have some additional information

here in the extracted

values so based on the address it has

automatically identified that ca is the

state

california and it's in united states

and the zip code is 94402

based on the value available in the

document

so as i see it's intelligent enough to

do some little conversions to

get the perfect output even much better

than what you see in the document

and for the issuer name we have the

value

and the date you can see the day

month and here separately

and the mn1 dead since it's not there it

has not extracted

and the rest we didn't configure

so that's how you can create

a template to extract

data from different documents so this

form extractor cannot be used

to on documents that change

time to time so let's assume that

this document has multiple rows

so for example if we take this table

if this table is going to have 10 rows

and sometimes

5 rows and sometimes 100 of rows

the form extractor will not work there

because

we will not know how many rows will be

there

and we cannot build a template on top of

that

but if the document is structured

and it's not the layout is not going to

change

we can easily use the form extractor to

specify

this is where you need to look at to

extract this field and this is where you

need to look at to extract

this field and likewise

so you might also have a concern if

you get the same document as a native

pdf

and if you get the same document as a

scanned copy

will that effect so basically

all the keywords will be same but you

are getting the same document

in two different formats one is the

digital version and one is the

scanned version so

in that case if you actually take this

hand version it will slightly differ

from the digital or the native pdf

because once you scan it might not be

fully straight

and the depending on the way you scan

the exact position might not be the same

so it's always preferred for the best

accuracy

use the same document in the same format

when you are using the

form extractor because it will look into

precise location to extract the value

that you are looking for

so in that case always try to use the

same format

to get whatever the value that you need

and if

you are using scanned copies

try to find the best possible approach

to deal with that and try to

find the best possible region

to extract each and every value

based on the different version of the

copies that you get

so that so in the first time you might

not

get the proper exact

value that you're looking at so you

might need to tweak the

template a little bit to fit in and get

the best output

so you can easily do that so let's

close it and if you want to edit the

template all you need to do is

click on this edit and it will open

the already configured template and you

just need to

resize or re

specify the region for that field

so let's assume that you need to realign

this field

so select

that field and just

respecify the region something like that

and get here change extracted

once you do that your new region will be

the latest so likewise you can keep on

configuring it until you get

the best possible output

so that's about the form extractor

and that's how we can configure

the form extractor to create templates

to extract values from different

locations and

merge it into one field

and you can easily do that

for any type of the document that does

not

change the layout

so that

comes when so along with that we come to

an end in this video

about the form extractor and in the

second the next video we will take a

look

at how we can use the rockets extractor

to extract data from this document

what you see over here and see

how we can get the values based on

we are a certain character is placed in

the document

and we can we will also see how

easily or how we can extract

values in a table

even though the rows are dying

so thank you very much for listening i

hope

this was uh helpful for you to

understand the form extractor and its

capabilities

thank you very much and i'll see you in

another video
