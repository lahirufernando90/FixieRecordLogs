hello everyone this is reaching out to

you again

to share some insights about the recent

ui path preview release 20.8

and to discuss one of the about one of

the latest

additions to the uipath platform which

is the uipath

data service so

what's up data service

it's actually a platform where you can

create relational data models

to store the data that you process

within each workflow that you are

running

and also you can use the data service as

a

temporary data saving location

for you to pass the data between

multiple processes or multiple

applications basically so why is it

important and what's the need for data

service

as you all know when

executing automation process we come

across

data and we extract data from various

different applications

and different sources such as excel

files flat files and so on

but where are we going to store this

data

as a temporary storage to pass that

data to another process or maybe to hold

that information until

some price is executed and so on as of

now

we have been using different databases

or even excel files or different text

files

to store those kind of data

and most importantly when you have

or when you are processing data that are

related to one another

or between if you have different

relationships between the data that you

process

at a time you actually need a database

to

store such kind of information until you

get it back for the next set of process

so that's where the uipath data service

comes into action

it's one of the latest additions in the

cloud platform because it's described

and we can use the data service to store

any type of data which are relational or

even even the data that do not have any

relationship with

another entity and you can

access read delete or even modify the

data that's

available in the data service so it's

more like a

simple sql database and

the good thing about this is that it's

integrated with the entire ui

platform so that whatever you create in

the data service it's

it will be available in studio uh

and rather robot is executing

another amazing thing about data service

is that it's a

drag and drop interface where you

actually you don't need to create

or write any code to create the data

entities

it's more like a if you

if you have a background where you have

worked with databases

especially with sql you have come across

the

tables where we actually store the data

so it's more

similar to that what we

store in data service are called as

entities

and each entity will have different

columns and those will be related to

different other entities as well

so it's simply thinking about it it's a

representation of a

simple database that can have relational

models and the other good thing is that

it's

supporting open api so that we can

integrate any application that we have

uh to data service without much of a

hassle

so how do you actually use it so let me

get to the actual application

so first thing is once you log into the

cloud platform

you will see a new option called data

service here

but by default this will not be enabled

for you

so what you need to do is you need to go

to admin

and under your tenant so i have already

enabled that but i'm going to show you

how to enable it

under dinner you just go to this option

and click on edit service

and click on this data service

and edit license and click on save

once you have done that within couple of

seconds

it will prepare your data service

environment and you will

see the data service option here so i

you can navigate to data service either

by this option

or you can click on the data service on

the left panel

so once you get into data service

this is the screen that you will get so

all the entities we create over here

will be listed

in this screen

so before creating any entities i would

like to show some

additional stuff like if you click on

these three dots next to create new

entity

that's option for user management

in this you will have all the available

users in your

environment and each user will have

particular roles as you can see here

so you can either add a user

or use a group and you can assign the

required roles for each user

and if you get to rows

we have these kind of rows over here

admin data reader

data right and a designer and you can

view the permission levels by clicking

on this

i option so as you see for the admin

uh we don't have any permissions granted

at the moment

but if you check the data reader the

data reader can

read a schema and you can also

read the data in that scheme

likewise if you check the data writer

the writer have

different access levels so he can read

the data

regret the schema and he can

read create edit and delete the data in

that schema

likewise if you check the designer

designer will

have no access to the data but he can

he will have all the access needed to

design

or create edit delete the data schemas

basically

so depending on your requirement you can

assign the different

users and user roles for the user

so getting back to the entity screen

how do you create a new entity so this

actually depends on the requirement

it based on the data that you need to

store in the data service

you need to create the entities so i

have a simple

requirement here i need to i actually

get this kind of data so assume that i

am getting this information from a

different system

and from some excel files like basically

so just to simulate that i have excel

file over here

so in the first sheet i have the student

id first name last name

and the and in the second shade

i have some activities that each and

every student is performing

and this and the activity name

registered date and the cost per month

for that particular activity

for each and every student so don't

worry about the data now

just worry about the columns that we are

focusing on

because at this level we are going to

create the entities

uh so all you need to know is what type

of

data is going to be stored in each and

every column

um so if it's registered there you can

see there is a date

if it's cost it could be your number and

so on and

you can see how these two are related

it's related by the student id

so we can include a relationship between

these two

so let's create some entities for these

two

so once you get here i can create

create and you end it by clicking on

this option or by clicking on the

uh option on the top right

so first thing you need to do is you

need to give a name for the entity

so for the first one i will say student

entity

and you can also provide your

description

[Music]

information and click on save

so now you have the first entity created

and you can see the name the description

and you can also see that by default it

has

five fields and zero rows

so what are these five fields and how we

can see that

is by clicking on this uh display name

so once you get into the student entity

you can see that few fields are created

automatically

and the id is a unique identifier for

each and every row

which is of type unique id basically

it's a

geo id if you are familiar with database

terms

and these things will basically have the

creator time created by

and those basic information

so what are the faces that we need to

add getting back to the excel i need to

add student id

first name last name and the edge

so let's do that now

so i'll be clicking on the create new

field option here

and i'll be adding student id

of type text so we have different types

as we see here

so if we take select text

you can also say whether it's the

required field or not

if you go into more details you can see

the maximum length

and if you have a default value for

example if you are not assigning any

value to that what's the default value

that needs to go in

and if you need to have a field

description that can also be included

here so i'm going to

keep this as it is and click on save

and you can see that that field is

available here so likewise

let's create the other fields

now i'm creating the student

first name and that's also going to be

text

and it's a required field i won't be

changing anything over here

the other one last name

again text it's required

and the edge so age i will

mark it as text as of now because you

are not going to do any calculations

and it's again required

so we have completed the first entity

now going back to the second entity here

we have different data types

and along with the relationship so let's

see how we can create that

so i'll be before getting into that if

you

moving moving to data tab you can

you will be able to see any available

data

over here so i'll get back to that later

so getting back to entities i'll be

needing to create another

entity i will say

student activities

so again we have that same default

fields

just like we had in the previous entity

and we just need to create the fees we

need and i'll be creating the student id

activity name registration date and cost

so the first field i will be saying

student id and this time it's not going

to be

a text but it's going to be a

relationship

because i need to relate the student id

with the student entity to get the

student information

so it will be a relationship and what's

the related

entity it's student

and in the student entity was the field

that we are going to

map the student id of the new entity we

are creating

it's in this drop-down you can select

student id

so because i have the same name in both

entities

i believe it will be showing as it is

and this is also a required field

and if you go into more details you will

have a

description to enter so it's not

mandatory

and let's click on save likewise you can

create the other fields

name and it's going to be a text as

earlier

now the next one is the date because i

have the registration date

so i'll be creating a new field

date of type

date time so here we have another option

whether

it's asking whether we need to hide the

time field

of the date so if we take the date

portion we have the date and the time

so if we don't need to store the time we

can hide that part

so i will not be needing the time

for now so i'll be saying to

hide the time field then it's required

and also if you have a default value if

this

fail comes in as empty was the default

date that you are going to

include you can select the date from the

date time picker that we have here

so as of now i don't need any debt

so i'll be ignoring that i click

on save and the last one is the cost

per month

so over here first

month and this time it's going to be a

number

so you must be wondering what's yes and

no

it's a boolean variable where you need

to say

whether it's true or false for example

and in the default value also we have

that option

so for the cost it's not a boolean so i

need a number

and again it's required and under more

details you can see

that it's asking for the maximum value

and the minimum value

and if you have any decimal places

how many decimal places so in my

scenario the cost is always

greater than zero so i can have the

maximum value as it is

but as a validation i would say

my minimum value is zero

and i will i would sometimes need

two decimal places so i'll leave it as

it is

and if you have any default value again

you can specify that

and the description and click on save

so that's how you actually create your

entities based on your requirement you

can have

any number of entities relating to each

other

through this relationship option and

how we are going to insert or update the

data

in these entities is going to be through

your uipath studio workflows that you

design

so that's a separate tutorial that's

coming in

quite soon uh so

as of now this is how you create the

entities and if you go into data

field you can you will be able to see if

there is any available data

and also you can create a simple

data row so i'll create so simple one in

studio

student go into data

and you can click on add new data or you

can click on add data

so here we can see all the trees

available

for that particular entity so i will say

student id

is something like that

and the first name is liverpool

and h i will say that

and if you click save that information

will be stored

in the entity and it will show under the

data type

so you can see the id which is our gui

id

and the values that we entered and by

default we have the created time created

by

and the other information

and if you get into the student

activities

and if you go into data and click on add

data

here under student id now remember this

student id

is a relationship type so it has to

have the data available in the student

entity

in the student field so what's the

available values over there

and you can see if i click on this drop

down

it will be showing the available values

so as of now we only have one so it's

showing the id

or the column that i have marked as the

relationship

which has the sd01 and it's showing the

gui id

or else i can also search for a specific

id like this

or else you can select from the

available options

and you can also view the entity data

over here

so that it will move to the student

entity

in a new tab and it will show the

available data

and you have the search option there as

well

so i will be selecting this one

and the activity name i will say

and the registration date this so by

default it

shows the today's date and i will say

the cost

is

a concept so now you can see that

it has the relationship

field like getting the data from the

student entity

and you have the other information that

we provided

so basically that's how you manually

enter data and that's

how the relationships are built

so when it comes to automation you are

not going to manually add the data over

here

you will be adding that through ui path

in studio so i'll be going through that

part in another video

so i'll see you there until then happy

automation
