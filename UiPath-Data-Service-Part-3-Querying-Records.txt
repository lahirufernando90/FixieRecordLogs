hello everyone this is lahiro again

bringing you the part three of uipath

data service video series

so in the part two we looked at

how to insert data into a

data entity we creating data service so

in the path three

we'll be looking at how we can query and

update the data

in the entities we created

so i have a simple scenario

so this is one of my entities as we did

in the previous

videos so in this entity i would like to

query

for the students who are doing swimming

so basically we have two students

who are who has activities as swimming

so i'll be get needing to get the

student names

and the edge of the guys who are

doing swimming as one requirement

and as a second requirement i'll be

also needing to update the cost of the

students who do swimming

and the cost so if a student

is doing swimming for less than 35

i need to update that particular record

as the cost cost as as

50. so

those are the two requirements so let's

see how we can

go about it and build a workflow

so as the first step we need to query

the data from the entity

so i need to get the student activities

and also the student details so

we'll be using the query

entity records

so in this one you need to select which

entity that you are going to

query so we have a relationship

i need to find the student information

of

the students who do swimming so i need

to look for the

activities and also i need to look for

the data in the students

entity so if you actually

select students here and go to query

editor and if you expand this

drop down you will see only the fields

in the students entity and i don't have

access to student activities

so what i can do is i will click cancel

and i will go for the student activities

and get back to the query editor

now if you expand this i can see the

fields

that i have in the activities entity

which is the cost per month registered

date

and activity name and so on and

also i can see the

fields available in the student entity

through the student id because student

id is the

relationship field that we used and here

we can

get access to their first name last name

and the end so through this we can get

the data we need from both entities

so i'll be using the student activities

entity to

get the required data

so as the first query i need to look for

the students who do

swimming as the activity so how to do

that

is i will look for the activity name

and i will say equal

and i can type swimming here

this query will give you all the records

that has swimming under the activity

name field

also if you need to build a query with

multiple commands

or with multiple group of commands

you can use add add row means it's

another

command along with

option if you go for add group

it will be a group of conditions

that you can build in inside the group

so for now i'll be using only one

condition

so you can explore how to use the

multiple conditions

so i'll leave that part for you guys so

if

once you provide this as framing

and i click ok

then i will get need to set the output

of this query so i'll press ctrl

k and i would say

student activities

so if you check the variables panel

this is a i list of student activities

type

okay now the next step

is i need to look through this

list to access the data in the

student activities type list so

basically it will

return all the information of the

students who are doing swimming and

the activity related details and also

the student details

so let's see how we can access them

so i'll be using out for each

and i will specify student activities

and this for each loop

has to be of type student

activities so i can select that from the

drop down here

now once i get

the records i need to get the

student id first name last name and the

edge

into a data table so that i can write it

into an excel

so let's create a data table first with

the fields that we need

build data table so basically

this table will have the same data types

as we have

in the students entity

so i need the student id first name last

name and h so i'll be using

string for all four

so i'll remove this

and i will say student id

first name

last name and finally the edge

so i have the data table now

i would say dt

swimming students

right now inside the loop

i need to use the add data row

activity to add the data into the

students

data table so i'll be using add row

feature

over here so now how

can i access the data in the

uh

how can i access the data in this

student activities item

so this is how you can access

the data in the students entity through

the students activities entity

so all you need to do is you can specify

item

dot and it will give you all the

available

fields in the student activities entity

so you won't see anything as you saw

earlier in the query editor

as student id dot first name last name

and so on

all you see is the fields we have in the

student activities

how you can access the students

fields is by using the

field that we use to build the

relationship

so if you use the student id you can see

that it's

of type students so i would say item dot

student id

and then i will specify the fields i

need from the students entity

so here we can access all those fields

so i would say student id is the id

field

okay so for the arrow i need

brackets

the next field is again student id dot

first name item

last name and finally

the edge so that's it that is how you

access

the data in the related entity

so once you do that click ok and you

need to provide the data table

now since you have configured that we'll

use a simple

right frame so that we can see

how the data looks like

so i'll just specify the

excel file name actually one looks good

and bt swimming students

okay so this is the first requirement

that i had

so let's run this and see what we can

get in the excel sheet

so as of now i have not created the

excel sheet as you can see here

so let me run this

so it will query the

entities and get the data into the excel

file

so and then if i refresh you can see the

output excel

and we have the data of the two students

uh who are doing swimming so basically

if you

can get back to data services

so i need to go to the other entity

the data here you can see ste001

and st002 are the guys who are doing

swim

and these are the details of those two

guys from the students

entity so you don't see the header

because i didn't

enable add headers

so i will do that now so now the second

requirement how can i update

the data so i need to update

uh the cost of the guys who are

doing swimming and if the cost

is less than 35 i need to update it as

50

so let's see how we can do that now

so since we have queried the data from

the students

activities we can use another for

each row so i'll leave this part as it

is

and use another for each to look through

the data

in the list and again it will be student

activities

and of type student activities

so in this i'll be looking through the

data and i need to check

whether the cost is less than 35

so for that i'll be needing a if

condition

in the if condition if you

specify item dot cost

per month so since now we are accessing

the data of the student activities

i don't need to use the related column

to access that field so it will be in

the

same entity so i'll say cost per month

and if you can see the data type is off

as decimal and we have a question mark

at the end

so it's not decimal that we use

normally so we need to convert that to

the decimal font so what i should do is

yeah so before that let me show you this

so if i do like this

and say less than 35

this will actually give you error saying

that you cannot convert

those two so what i need to do is i need

to

convert this into the decimal format

so i will say decimal dot pass

and filter so this will

convert the value you get from this cost

per month field into a decimal

and you can compare that with the

value that we are looking for so if it

is less than 35

then i need to update

the cost as 50

so this is where we need to specify

which row that we should update so for

example you might have

multiple rows that fit into that

condition

so how does it know that this is the row

that it should update

so that's the part where it

identifies the row using the id field

using this unique id so whenever we are

specifying a

update we need to specify the id

of the row that we need to update so

let's see how we can do that

so first of all we need to have a

variable of stripe student entities

student activities

so to do that easily you can

use the entities in the project panel

and drag it over here and it will create

a variable for you

so i will specify updated

student activities

and i need to

initialize that so i'll be using a

multiple assign again

the first thing is to initialize that

so i'll be saying updated student

activities variables

of type new student

activities so this will initialize that

and next we need to provide the field

id so which field are we going to update

because through this uh

query we did over here

this returns all the data

related to that condition we have

specified

here and it will have all the fields

including the id field

and all the related entities fields as

well

so we can easily use the properties of

that

to identify which row we are looking at

because

we are looking through each item in the

list

one at a time so

i'll be specifying updated student

activities

i need to find the id so if you type id

it will be

available id

and if i say item which is

the looping variable over here

item dot id is the

row that we need to update because

we are iterating through a list

so once we have specified that we also

need to specify all the other fields

uh because if we only specify the field

that we

are going to update it means that

these fields will be empty and if those

are marked as required

it will throw you an error so every time

when you are doing update we need to

provide the values for all the fields

so how we are going to get those values

we already have that

in the variable which we created through

the query

option so we can use the same set of

fields

so i will say updated activities

and i need to specify the student id

which is of type students so this is the

related relationship

field so how do you specify that

so just create the field over here

and if you if you can remember how we

got the data from the students entity

through the student activities is by the

student

id that's how we specified

in this data row so this is of type

student so that's the relationship

field so similarly you can specify that

here

you can say item dot student id

of this type students

and that will pick it up

and then we have the other columns

activity name again we have that in the

item

activity name

and the resist creation date

item the registration debt

and finally the field that we

really need to update cost per month

so for this one it expects

a decimal so i'll be specifying

50 because that's the one that's the

value i need to update

so basically over here we have one row

that needs to be updated

so this should get updated through our

workflow

so i have configured the fails now

now

now what i need to do is i need to use

the

another activity to update

so i'll be using update entity record uh

so i'll be dragging it over here

right below the multiple assign

and i need to specify which entity i'm

going to update so it's going to be

student activities

and the input record is going to be the

this variable we created

and the output of that i assign it to

the same variable

okay so by running this workflow we

should be able to update

our data in the entity so let's

give it a run

so you can see that it's running

and it has completed and we didn't come

across any errors

so let's see how our output looks like

so if we get to the student activities

and do a refresh

we can see that this record has been

updated

as 50 for swimming

so that's how you do the update

and if we

check the

if you check the

output excel file you can also

see the student of

students who do streaming now with the

column ids because i enabled that

so that's how you do the update entities

through the workflows so we have

two other activities over here

so how are we to delete or to

get a record by id

so as you know as of now as we cover

several steps over here

so if you have to do a delete if you

want to

drag it to the same workflow you just

need to specify

which entity is going to be affected and

it

asks for id so you already know that

what this id means it is the

field that represent uh

has the unique reference for each row

so every time when you are deleting you

need to specify that

same thing happens for the update even

though the activity doesn't say that

it's

being updated by the id we need to

provide that and that's how he's going

to identify the role

[Music]

so when it comes to deleting it's the

same

concept you just need to first query

the entity as we did in our workflow

and find the id and provide that here

so that it will delete that specific

record

and it comes with the get entity record

by

id this again

uses the same

id field to get the data

by specifying a specific id so again to

get that id

you just need to query again or you

should

have that information available within

your workflow

so that you can pass that to this field

and get the output

the output will be of this activity the

output will be

of type uh if you specify student

activities it

the output will create a new variable of

student activities type if you select

something else it will be

of that particular type so that's

how you can use

all these activities related to data

services which are available as of now

and i hope uh my videos helped you to

get an

understanding on how to use the data

service

how to create entities and how you can

build workflows to insert

update query and also delete

records that are in these entities that

we created

so thank you for listening and this is

the

last video of the data service uh

series that i came across with so if you

are seeing this video for the first time

please refer to the

part 1 2 and also the interactive

signing

videos that i created and follow that

path and it will be easy for you to

understand

and again thank you for listening and

have a nice day
