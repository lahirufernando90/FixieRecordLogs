hello again this is nairo so

in this video we'll be covering the

next set of activities that we need to

follow in the data service

uh demo so in the first part we covered

how to create the data service and

how to create different entities in the

data service

so in this video we'll be seeing how we

can use the entities we created

in the uipath workflows

so just to recap if i am to

quickly show you

so in the first video we created two new

entities called the student and student

activities and we created some test data

to see how it works so for you to access

this data service

there are few things that we need to

follow

first thing is you need to create your

or connect your assistant to your path

orchestrator

through the interactive sign-in option

so

how to do that i have covered that in

the interactive

in video you can go through that and set

it up

so once you have connected with the

interactive sign in

you can connect the studio with the

entities we have created over here

so if you have studio open

[Music]

if you have the studio open if you go to

resources panel

and click on this cloud options over

here and click on refresh

it will refresh the resources that you

have access to

and you can see the two entities that we

have created over here and it also says

how many recalls that are available

as of now i don't have any records

so in the workflow i have

so in the workflow i have three

excel files which i am planning to use

if i want to quickly show you

so for each student i have a excel file

in the sheet one we have the student

information in the sheet2 we have the

activities of

that particular student

uh as we see here so

this student has activities the previous

student did not have any activities

and there is another one so he has three

activities

so we'll be using these three uh excel

files

to add this data into

the entities we created so why i have

three excel files is to simplify the

flow others so that i can focus on the

logic that we need to

use to connect and add the data into

data entities we created

so the throw will be simple

so the first things first so first i

need to

get the entities onto my solution so

on the project panel you can see your

option called entities

but you do not see the two entities

that are available in the data service

so how you can do that is you can get to

manage

entities on the top folder and here it

will show

what are the available entities and you

can

enable the entities or select the

entities you need for the process

and click on save so whenever there are

any updates after you add

the entities into your project it will

show it in a different color over here

so all you need to do is save it again

so that the changes will be applied

so let's save this for now

so it will be installed in the entities

into your solution

now if you check the project panel you

can see

uh the two entities under data service

demo

which is my solution name and the two

entities are available

for for you to use also you can see a

small

notification on the top saying that you

need to install the

different package to use it

the data services so if you click on

install package

it will look for your data service

activities

and as of now you only have the 20.8.1

for you so i'll install that

so this will give you a set of

activities for you to use to connect

with the

entities we have created so if you get

to activities final

you'll see a new set of activities under

data service

if you expand you have five activities

first one is to

create new records in different entities

second is to delete

and get recalls by id

query the record and update so first

we'll be using the first one

so to create the workflow now i have

three different

files in an input folder so i need to

loop through that

so let's create a simple

uh set of activities to go through that

so i can use the assign

and i'll be giving the

fold the path free dot

get files

so i'll be using the input data folder

so this fold is inside this acceleration

so i'll be

using only that folder name

so i'll be taking the folder file list

into a

file list error

and i'll be changing the data type to

string header

and once you have configured that

next is

you need to have a loop to look through

the files

so i can use a for each

i'll be specifying file list

and changing the object type to string

because the data

file paths are in the string format

now i need to read the data

in the two sheets of each excel file

so i'll be using a read range for that

so if you actually check uh

each file

you can see that i have two sheets which

is sheet1 and sheet2

that has the student data and his

related activities

so i'll create that now

so for the file file i'll be specifying

item because it holds the file path

and the range is blank

so for sheet one i'll be saying

this will help student data

and also i need to get the data from the

sheet 2

so again it's item

the range is blank

sheet is sheet 2 and i'll be having a

different data table

student activities data

now the next step is we need to add the

data

in these sheet or in the data table

into a variable a rich

data type of

type student and student activities

so how do we create rich data types

for these two it's quite simple

so i will create the variable

in the sequence form uh over here in the

sequence scope

so all you need to do is click on the

entity

drag it to the variables panel and it

will create

that variable for you and we just need

to

rename it i'll say students

and let's do the same for students

activities

student activities

now next is we need to initialize this

uh variables otherwise it will throw out

errors saying that

you are assigning it to a undefined

variable

so we'll use the simple assign

activity to do that so i'll be using

multiple assign

so i can say simply students

and new students

similarly i can do that for the student

activities as well

right now

now i can get the values from these two

data tables and assign it

to the properties of students and

student activities

so as you know in the first excel or

in every excel the first sheet has only

one row

and in the second sheet there can be

multiple rows

so i'll be using different approaches on

these two

so over here inside the loop

under the second read range i'll use a

multiple assign again

so when you're assigning if you check

the resources panel

in students you can also see the data

type of the fields that are available

in the data service or in the entity

so based on this data type we need to

assign or convert the values that we are

assigning

so in the first entity which is the

student most of the

page that we need to assign is string

so we are looking at student id first

name last name and edge

others are predefined fields

so how you can access this phrase is by

giving the students dot

student id so this student is referring

to the variable we have created over

here

so it's the variable name and once you

give the dot and look for it it will

provide all the available fields

so since the first data table has only

one row

i'll be specifying i'll be using that

i'll be accessing the data without using

a loop over here

so i would say student

data dot rose okay

saying the zeroth row because it's the

first row and in the zeroth column

will have the student id

which is referring to this cell

zeroth row and the zeroth column in

terms of data tables

so i'll do that

and so i have provided the student id

next to the student name

the first name first name

and i'll be doing the same thing

but specifying it as the second column

or which is the first column in data

table

column indexes

and we're doing the same thing again for

the next set of columns

students dot last name

which is the second

and the last column students

dot edge and you can also see the data

type over here it specifies as string

and over here is the third index

so i have assigned the values to the

four properties that i need to

assign the values that i have and what

we have to do next is

i need to create this record in the

entity

so remember we have two data sets

and we have two entities that we need to

calculate but the student

activities entity is related to

students using the student id

so we first need to populate the

students

uh entity in order to populate data

in the student activities respectively

for a student available in the student

entity

so we'll first create this record and to

do that

we just need to

go to data service activities and use

the create entity record

so i'll be using that over here right

below

so for the entity type we need to select

which entity

we are going to enter the recalls into

so from the drop down you can select if

the entities are available over here or

else you can browse for the types

and if you expand data service

and data service demo you will be seeing

the

entities so i can select students

and the input record is going to be the

students

variable so i'll be saying

students and we have output record

so it's again of the type students

so this will return the data once you

have entered

along with few other properties that we

can use to

use along with the related entities

so i'll be getting the output into the

same student's entity

so it will be overwriting the tree lio

variable i already had and

in the next data table so this up to

this point it will

add the data into that particular entity

and now i have

the second data table where i have the

student activities

and it can have multiple rows and we

don't know how many rows will be there

so i'll be using a for each row activity

right below this

for each row and

i'll be specifying the second data table

students activities data

and now again since we have created

the

[Music]

or we have created the new variable over

here have we not

needed to do that again so over here

i'll be directly

assigning the values into the

variable using a multiple assign as we

did over here

so again i'll be using multiple assign

so this time i'll be specifying the

students

activities again that's the variable

that i have created over here of

student activities type student

activities

dot the first one is the student id

so look at this here the student id

is of type students but

if you check over here the student id

is of type

string so why we have students over

there is because

it is the field that we used to

build the relationship between the

student activities and with the student

so this field has to be of students time

and that has to be of a particular

record available in the student

entity so we'll be specifying that

so we already inserted one record

for the first student and that's the

record that we need to refer

over here for us to

enter the activities related to that

particular student so are we specifying

this

output variable which is the students

as the input

for the student id

field we have in the student activities

so that will hold the unique id

and the references required to link with

that particular record

and if you check the student activities

or entity here in the resources panel

you again have the type as guid

which is the reference of available in

the students entity

for that particular record and apart

from that

the rest of the fields where we have

is the activity name

and registered dead

and the cost per month so i can use the

student activities

activity name which is a string

so i can specify row so here i'll be

specifying the column name in the excel

which is activity name

and string and

in the second one student activities

and the registered date this one is of

date type

so whatever the value that i'm entering

i need to convert that to a date format

and in the excel we have it in we have a

date

so let's convert that so how we are

going to do that

is by using datetime.com

specifying the row and column name which

is the register

date

string this will convert the string that

we are extracting

into a time format

and the last part student

activities which is the cost per month

and this one is of decimal type

and we have in itself like this so we

need to convert this to decimal

so again just like we did earlier we can

say decimal

dot pass

cost per month

to stream

now we have assigned the values to the

variable that we have created and again

simply we need to use

the same activity over here create

entity record

to insert the values we have in this

particular data table

for that particular student so i'll be

using

create entity record again

and this time i'll be selecting student

activities

and input record is going to be student

activities deleted

variable and i'll be assigning the

output

to the same variable

so this is how you enter records so what

will happen here is

it will read the two sheets in that

particular file

it will assign the values of the student

to this variable and it will create the

recording the entity

next for the student activities it will

get the activities

one at a time and insert that

insert each row into the next activity

uh one by one referring to the

record we have created in the first

entity

so we can run this and

see

so you can simply so if i'm

to show you as of now we don't have any

records in these two

entities so let's give this a run

so you can see the records are being

added to the

entities so the process completed

successfully

without any errors so if we get back to

the data service and give it a refresh

we can see that

we have new rows over here so let's

check the students

entity first like we go to data you can

see the

three records that we added from the

three files

so for the first student this is the

information second student and the third

student so remember in the excel file

from the

student we have only the student

information

but we don't have the student activity

data

so this is excel and we don't have any

student activities

let's see how that has worked out get to

the students

activities now

and you can see the references has been

built successfully and we are seeing the

references according to

what we have in our excel sheets so the

first student has

only two reports the second guy has

three activities

and the third one has no activities

in excel so we don't have any recalls in

the student activities entity

so this is how you build a simple

workflow

to insert records into the entities we

have created

in so these entities can be related to

each other

and that's how we build the

relationships

within the ui path workflows

so in the next set of activities we'll

see how we can use this

uh use the next

set of activities to

uh delete entities in a delete request

in entities

or how we can query the records

available in entities

and we'll basically look at how we can

use the

other four activities over here

so thank you very much for listening and

see i will

see you in the next set of videos to

showcase how we can use the next set of

activities until then

happy automation
